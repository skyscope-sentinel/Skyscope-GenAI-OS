**Subject: Revised Stage 1 Task - Microkernel SILA Design Specification V0.1**

**To: Microkernel Architect**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 1 (Revised) - Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design**
**Iteration: 1 (Post-Stage 0)**

**Directive:**

Following the foundational work in Stage 0, you are now tasked with producing the **Microkernel SILA Design Specification V0.1**. This document will adapt and evolve the initial microkernel concepts to be fully expressed and implementable using the **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)** programming language. It must also detail interactions with SKYAIFS and the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism.

**Key Requirements for the SILA-based Design Specification:**

1.  **SILA-Native Architecture:**
    *   Redefine the microkernel's core services (IPC, memory management, scheduling, capabilities) and their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in terms of SILA constructs. Specify how these services would be defined, invoked, and managed using SILA's semantic graph representation and agent-oriented features.
    *   Illustrate how SILA's inherent features (e.g., PQC-aware data types, capability tokens as first-class citizens, verifiable control flow, policy-driven execution) will be leveraged to enhance the microkernel's security, verifiability, and efficiency.

2.  **Integration with Core Stage 0 Technologies:**
    *   **SKYAIFS Support:** Define the necessary SILA interfaces or privileged primitives the microkernel must provide to support the AI-orchestrated operations of SKYAIFS (e.g., secure access to raw storage capabilities, fault reporting channels).
    *   **Deep Compression Support:** Specify how the microkernel will interact with the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism, particularly during early boot (for decompressing core kernel components if needed) and for managing memory for on-demand decompression of SILA modules.

3.  **Runtime Immutability in a SILA Context:**
    *   Detail how runtime immutability of critical kernel code and data structures (now represented in SILA's compiled binary format) will be enforced. This should include hardware memory protection mechanisms (MMU configuration) and how SILA's capability system and metadata layer contribute to this.

4.  **Formal Verifiability Approach:**
    *   Outline a strategy for achieving formal verification of the SILA-based microkernel, considering SILA's design for verifiability and the role of the SILA toolchain (Verifier, Analyzer).

**Output Format:**

*   A conceptual design document (Markdown or similar, describing SILA structures and interactions conceptually) that outlines the microkernel's architecture, services, and APIs as they would be realized in SILA.
*   Focus on the logical design and how SILA constructs map to microkernel requirements. (Actual SILA 'code' generation is not expected at this V0.1 specification stage).

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'Microkernel SILA Design Specification V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

This SILA-based specification is a critical first step in realizing the Skyscope OS vision. Your design will be integrated with SILA-based designs from the Filesystem Engineer and AI Pipeline Specialist.

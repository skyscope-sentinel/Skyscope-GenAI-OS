# SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem) Conceptual Framework - V0.1 - Iteration 1

**Based on:** `SKYAIFS_Conceptual_Framework_V0.1.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Initial alignment of SKYAIFS concepts with SILA V0.2; representing AI Bots as SILA ASAs; PQC type integration for metadata; initial thoughts on SILA policies for bots.

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from V0.1. Iteration 1 emphasizes expressing these principles through SILA V0.2 constructs, as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`.
*   **AI-Orchestrated:** This will be achieved by defining SKYAIFS supervisor agents and individual functional bots (e.g., for defragmentation, data relocation) as **SILA ASAs (Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents)**. Their logic, communication, and state will be expressed using SILA semantic graphs.
*   **Dynamic & Adaptive:** The behavior of SKYAIFS ASAs will be adaptable through updatable SILA policies and by leveraging SILA's event-driven constructs to react to real-time system events.
*   **Resilient & Self-Healing:** SILA's verifiable error handling, fault tolerance patterns (Retry, Circuit Breaker via ADK), and module contracts will be used to build resilient SKYAIFS ASAs.
*   **PQC-Secured:** All persistent SKYAIFS data structures (file content, metadata) will be defined using **SILA V0.2 PQC-aware types**. For example, file content might be stored as `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<MLKEM_1024, SILA_Data_Chunk_Array>` and metadata blocks as `SILA_PQC_Signed<MLDSA_5, SKYAIFS_MetadataNode_Record>`. The minimum 4096-bit equivalent security level (e.g., Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) is a baseline enforced by SILA type definitions.
*   **Unmodifiable Core Metadata:** Core filesystem metadata structures, when updated, will result in new PQC-signed versions of the relevant SILA graph segments, leveraging SILA's support for immutable data structures. Old versions are archived or superseded based on SKYAIFS policy.

## 2. Dynamic Block/Sector Management (SILA V0.2 Alignment)
*   **Variable-Sized Logical Blocks:** These will be represented by a SILA Record, e.g.,
    `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record {
      block_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      actual_size_bytes: SILA_Verifiable_Integer,
      pqc_content_checksum: SILA_PQC_Hash_Record<SHA3_256>, // Hash of the (potentially encrypted) content
      storage_location_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_Microkernel_RawBlockDevice_Area_Type>, // Capability to the physical storage region
      encryption_key_ref_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Key_Object_Type>> // Capability to the specific PQC encryption key for this block's content
    }`.
*   **AI-Managed Allocation:** An "SKYAIFS_AllocationManager_ASA" will be responsible for managing free space. Free space itself might be represented as a complex SILA graph structure (e.g., a B-tree of free extents), PQC-signed to ensure its integrity. This ASA provides SILA operations for allocating and freeing logical block descriptors.
*   **Metadata for Dynamic Structures:** The mapping from file logical offsets to `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record` capabilities will be a SILA graph structure (e.g., an extent tree) associated with each file's metadata. This mapping structure is itself PQC-signed and versioned.

## 3. AI Bot Orchestration (SILA V0.2 Implementation)

### 3.1. Bot Representation as SILA ASAs
Each SKYAIFS AI bot type (Defragmentation, Data Relocation, Predictive Placement, Integrity Verification) will be implemented as one or more specialized SILA ASAs, as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`.
*   A **SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA** acts as the primary orchestrator, receiving high-level directives (e.g., from system policies or other OS management agents via SILA IPC) and dispatching tasks to specialized bot ASAs.
*   Individual bot ASAs (or teams of worker ASAs for parallelizable tasks like scanning) will manage their own state (as SILA Records) and communicate with the Supervisor and other system services (like the Microkernel or Key Management ASAs) using SILA IPC. Messages exchanged between ASAs, especially if crossing defined trust boundaries, will use PQC-encrypted SILA message types.

### 3.2. Example: Integrity Verification Bot (as a SILA ASA)
*   **ASA Definition:** Declared using ADK, specifying its mailbox capability type, state record type, and public methods (SILA operations it can receive).
*   **State Machine:** Its internal logic will be modeled as a SILA state machine (defined via ADK patterns). States could include: `Idle`, `ScanningMetadataTree`, `RequestingBlockRead(block_id)`, `VerifyingBlockChecksum(block_data_cap)`, `ReportingAnomalies`.
*   **Operation Example (Conceptual SILA Graph Snippet for `VerifyingBlockChecksum` state):**
    1.  ASA receives `SILA_BlockDataForChecksum_Event` (containing `block_data_cap` from Microkernel and expected `pqc_checksum_from_metadata`).
    2.  Invokes SILA cryptographic primitive: `computed_hash = SILA_PQC_Hash_Operation<SHA3_256>(block_data_cap)`.
    3.  Compares `computed_hash` with `pqc_checksum_from_metadata` using SILA comparison operations.
    4.  If mismatch: Constructs `SILA_IntegrityAnomaly_Report_Record` and sends it via SILA IPC to `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA_EP_Cap`.
    5.  Transitions to next state (e.g., `RequestingNextBlockForScan` or `Idle`).

### 3.3. Bot Policies in SILA
*   The operational behavior and permissions of SKYAIFS AI bot ASAs will be governed by `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` structures, as detailed in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`.
*   **Example Policy for Data Relocation Bot ASA:**
    A `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` bound to the Relocation Bot ASA might include:
    *   A `SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap` that checks if a `RelocateData_Trigger_Event` (SILA message) originates from an authorized `OS_SecurityManager_ASA_CapToken`. If not, the `Deny` action is taken.
    *   Another rule might specify resource limits (e.g., "RateLimit invocations of `SILA_Microkernel_SecureBatchCopy_Op` to X per minute").
    *   Another rule could enforce that any PQC keys used for re-encryption during relocation must be obtained via a specific `KeyManagement_ASA_Service_CapToken` and meet certain strength requirements defined in the rule's parameters.
*   These policies are PQC-signed and bound to the bot ASAs. The SILA runtime and/or Verifier enforce these rules, ensuring bots operate within defined security and operational boundaries.

## 4. PQC Integration (SILA V0.2 Types & Operations)
*   **Universal PQC Application:** All SKYAIFS data structures representing file content, metadata, bot states, or internal logs will be defined in SILA using PQC-aware types from `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`. This ensures that cryptographic protection (min 4096-bit) is integral to the data's definition.
    *   File Content Block Example: `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<MLKEM_1024, SILA_RawData_Chunk_Array>`
    *   File Metadata Record Example: `SILA_PQC_Signed<MLDSA_5, SKYAIFS_FileInode_SILA_Record>`
*   **Unique Key Management via SILA Capabilities:** Access to unique PQC encryption/decryption keys for file content blocks or signing/verification keys for metadata will be managed through `SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Key_Object_Type>`. These capabilities are obtained by SKYAIFS ASAs from a dedicated "SKYAIFS_KeyManager_ASA" which, in turn, interfaces with a system-wide, microkernel-protected secure key vault or PQC key derivation service (all via SILA IPC and capabilities).
*   **SILA Type System Enforcement:** The SILA type system, as interpreted by the ADK, Compiler, and Verifier, will ensure that operations on these PQC-aware structures are only possible if the SKYAIFS ASA possesses the necessary cryptographic key capabilities with appropriate rights (e.g., a capability granting only encryption with a specific public key).

## 5. Interface with Microkernel (SILA V0.2 APIs)
*   SKYAIFS ASAs will interact with the SILA-based Microkernel exclusively through its formally defined SILA IPC interfaces, as conceptualized in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md` and to be detailed in future Microkernel SILA design documents.
    *   Example for raw storage access: An SKYAIFS ASA would use a `SILA_CapToken<SILA_Microkernel_StorageDevice_Interface>` to invoke operations like `SILA_Microkernel_ReadBlock_Op(device_area_cap, lba, buffer_cap)`.
    *   Memory for SKYAIFS operations and caches will be requested via `SILA_Microkernel_AllocateMemory_Op`, returning a `SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>`.
*   All interactions are mediated by SILA capabilities, enforcing that SKYAIFS ASAs only access resources they are explicitly authorized for. Faults or errors returned by Microkernel SILA operations will be handled using SILA's defined error handling mechanisms.

## Iteration 1 Conclusion
This first iteration has focused on establishing the foundational mapping of SKYAIFS core concepts (AI-orchestration, dynamic blocks, PQC security, resilience) to the constructs and principles defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`. Key steps include envisioning AI bots as SILA ASAs, specifying the use of SILA's PQC-aware types for all SKYAIFS data structures, and outlining how bot behavior can be governed by SILA execution policies. The interface with the Microkernel is now framed in terms of SILA API calls using capabilities. Subsequent iterations will delve into the detailed SILA semantic graph logic for these ASAs, refine the dynamic block management algorithms in SILA, and further elaborate on the PQC key lifecycle within SKYAIFS.The file `SKYAIFS_Framework_V0.1.iter1.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 1 for the SKYAIFS Conceptual Framework. The next step is to report this completion.

# SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents) Specification - V0.2.0 (Final - Iteration 4)

**Based on:** `SILA_Specification_V0.1.iter3.md`
**This Version (V0.2.0) Goals:** Introduce Meta-SILA/Reflection, elaborate on high-level intent translation for AI agents, touch on ecosystem integration, and consolidate the specification into a coherent whole.

## 1. Name & Core Philosophy
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents) remains dedicated to AI-first development, formal verifiability, PQC-embedded security (minimum 4096-bit equivalent), and efficiency for OS construction. Non-human readability is a core design tenet.

## 2. Abstract Syntax & Structure
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA programs are represented as rich Semantic Graphs. Nodes are operations or data structures; typed edges (e.g., `ControlFlow_Conditional`, `DataFlow_Typed`, `CapabilityFlow_Restricted`, `PolicyBinding_Edge`) define relationships. Nodes possess attributes like `Node_PQC_Context_Attribute` and `Node_Verification_Annotation`.

## 3. Key Semantic Concepts

### 3.1. Data Types
Retained from Iteration 3.
*   **Primitive Types:** Verifiable Integers, Secure Booleans, Parameterized `SILA_CapToken<Referenced_SILA_Type_Descriptor_Cap>`.
*   **Complex Types:**
    *   **PQC-Aware Structures:** Defined via ADK (e.g., `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Define_PQC_Struct_Type`) specifying explicit PQC algorithms (e.g., MLKEM_1024 for encryption, MLDSAdithium-5 for signatures, adhering to min 4096-bit security policy), key management policies, and optional integrity algorithms.
    *   **Agent-Oriented Records & Immutable Data Structures.**
*   **No Nulls:** `SILA_Optional<Type_Cap>` used for potentially absent values.

### 3.2. Control Flow
Retained from Iteration 3.
*   **Primary Concurrency Model:** Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents (ASAs) with private state and message-based communication using immutable, PQC-aware SILA messages.
*   **Guarded Execution:** For controlled shared resource access.
*   **Policy-Driven Execution:** `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` (PQC-signed) attached to modules/graphs, with rules defined as `SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap`.
*   **Error Handling & Fault Tolerance:** Typed `SILA_Error_Record`s, `SILA_Result_Union` for operations, ADK patterns for Retry, Circuit Breaker, and conceptual Redundancy/Voting.

### 3.3. Memory Management Model
Retained from Iteration 3. Capability-based, region-managed, and tightly integrated with the SILA-based microkernel's memory services.

### 3.4. AI Integration Features
Retained from Iteration 3 (Native AI model invocation using capabilities to versioned, PQC-signed models; secure data pipelines).
*   **Elaboration on High-Level Intent Translation:**
    *   The SILA Agent Development Kit (ADK) will provide a "Goal-Oriented SILA Synthesis Engine." This engine is a sophisticated AI component within the ADK.
    *   **Input to Engine:** AI developer agents can submit high-level goals. These goals can be expressed in a structured, formal goal language (itself potentially defined as a SILA vocabulary) or via a restricted natural language interface that the ADK's AI front-end can parse into this formal goal language.
        *   Example Goal (Formal Language Snippet):
          `Define Goal SecureChannel_Goal_ID {
             Objective: Establish_PQC_Encrypted_Duplex_Channel;
             Participants: { AgentA_ASA_Cap: SILA_CapToken, AgentB_ASA_Cap: SILA_CapToken };
             QoS_Parameters_Ref: SILA_QoS_Record_Cap;
             PQC_Policy_Ref: SILA_PQC_ChannelPolicy_Cap; // Specifies algorithms like MLKEM_1024, min key strengths
             Verification_Contract_Ref: SILA_ChannelContract_Spec_Cap; // Contract the resulting SILA graph must satisfy
           }`
    *   **Synthesis Process:** The Synthesis Engine utilizes:
        1.  A library of PQC-signed, verified SILA architectural patterns (e.g., patterns for establishing various types of secure IPC, resource allocation patterns, fault tolerance wrappers).
        2.  The current system state and available resources (queried via capability-restricted SILA reflection/introspection, see 3.7).
        3.  AI planning and reasoning algorithms to select, combine, and parameterize these patterns to generate a candidate SILA semantic graph (or a set of interacting ASAs) that aims to achieve the specified goal.
    *   **Output & Verification:** The generated SILA graph(s) are then passed to the standard SILA Verifier (with the `Verification_Contract_Ref` from the goal) and subjected to automated testing within the AI pipeline before any deployment. If verification or testing fails, the Synthesis Engine can attempt to refine the graph or report failure with diagnostics to the requesting AI agent.

### 3.5. Formal Verifiability Enhancements
Retained from Iteration 3. Central are `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s (specifying interfaces, pre/postconditions, temporal properties, information flow policies) which are PQC-signed and verified by the SILA Verifier. Information Flow Control uses SILA type system extensions for sensitivity labels.

### 3.6. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Interaction
Retained from Iteration 3. AI agents write SILA device drivers interacting with hardware via typed `SILA_Device_CapToken<Specific_Device_Type_Descriptor_Cap>` granted by the microkernel. Microkernel provides SILA operations for register access, DMA management (via `SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken`), and interrupt handling (IPC to driver ASA's endpoint).

### 3.7. Meta-SILA / Reflection Capabilities (New Section)
SILA provides limited, secure, and verifiable reflection capabilities for trusted AI agents (e.g., system orchestrators, debuggers, advanced ADK tools). These are designed to prevent abuse and maintain system integrity. All Meta-SILA operations are themselves SILA operations requiring specific, non-default capabilities.
*   **Type Introspection (Verifiable & Secure):**
    *   `SILA_KernelService_Reflect_GetTypeInformation(target_type_descriptor_cap: SILA_CapToken, requesting_agent_credentials_cap: SILA_CapToken) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_TypeInformation_Record, SILA_Error_Record>`
    *   Returns a PQC-signed `SILA_TypeInformation_Record` describing a type: its fields, PQC attributes (without revealing keys), associated contracts, version. Access is capability-controlled and auditable. It does not allow arbitrary code execution or direct memory inspection of type instances.
*   **Capability Rights Inspection (Abstract & Secure):**
    *   `SILA_KernelService_Reflect_GetCapabilityAbstractRights(target_cap_token: SILA_CapToken, introspector_agent_cap: SILA_CapToken) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_CapabilityRights_Summary_Record, SILA_Error_Record>`
    *   Allows an agent to understand the *kind* of operations and general rights (e.g., read, write, invoke specific interface) a *given* capability permits on its referent, without revealing the raw token value, its full internal structure, or allowing forgery. This is primarily for AI agents to self-assess their permissions or for debuggers to display abstract rights.
*   **Module Contract Introspection (Secure):**
    *   `SILA_KernelService_Reflect_GetModuleContract(target_module_instance_cap: SILA_CapToken, introspector_agent_cap: SILA_CapToken) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_Module_Contract_Record_Cap, SILA_Error_Record>`
    *   Allows trusted system services or monitoring AI agents to retrieve the PQC-signed, declared contract of a SILA module instance for runtime compliance assessment, adaptation decisions, or to provide context to the Goal-Oriented Synthesis Engine.
*   **Security Constraints on Meta-SILA:**
    *   All Meta-SILA operations are privileged and require specific capabilities not granted to general modules.
    *   They are designed to be read-only regarding system structure; they do not allow direct modification of types, capabilities, or contracts at runtime (such changes go through verified ADK/Pipeline processes).
    *   The information returned is structured as verifiable SILA records and is PQC-signed by the providing kernel service.
    *   Formal verification will be applied to Meta-SILA implementation to ensure it doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.

## 4. Non-Human Readability & AI Accessibility
Retained from Iteration 3. Compiled SILA is opaque; PQC-signed metadata is key.

### 4.1. Agent Development Kit (ADK) - Further Refinements
*   The ADK is the primary interface for AI agents to interact with SILA. It heavily utilizes Meta-SILA capabilities for its "Goal-Oriented SILA Synthesis Engine" to understand current system state and available component contracts.
*   ADK APIs for fault tolerance patterns, version-aware module generation, and hardware interaction patterns are retained.
*   The ADK provides advanced, non-human-interpretable visualization tools for AI agents to "perceive" and "reason about" complex SILA semantic graphs, their contracts, dependencies, and potential verification issues.

## 5. Toolchain Concept (AI-Driven)
Retained from Iteration 3. The SILA Verifier is a cornerstone, now also responsible for checking properties derived from or related to Meta-SILA introspection (e.g., ensuring an agent's intended action based on reflected rights is actually permitted by the original capability).

## 6. SILA Runtime Security Considerations
Retained from Iteration 3. The SILA runtime must securely and verifiably implement the new Meta-SILA primitives, ensuring that information is disclosed only to appropriately privileged AI agents and that the reflection mechanisms themselves cannot be used to bypass security policies or cause system instability.

## 7. SILA Language Versioning & Evolution
Retained from Iteration 3. Semantic versioning for the SILA language, module manifest specification of target SILA version, runtime compatibility checks, and ADK/toolchain version awareness are key.

## 8. Ecosystem Integration Points (New Section)
*   **AI Pipeline Integration:**
    *   The AI Pipeline orchestrates the entire lifecycle of SILA modules: AI agent-driven generation via ADK -> Version control of SILA source graphs -> SILA Compilation -> SILA Verification (against contracts & policies) -> PQC Signing -> Packaging (including metadata, contracts, deep compression headers) -> Deployment to PQC-secured Module Repository.
    *   Automated testing of SILA modules, using SILA-based test harness ASAs and leveraging Meta-SILA for test oracle assertions, is a critical pipeline stage.
    *   The pipeline uses PQC-signed SILA metadata for dependency analysis, version compatibility checks, and deployment decisions.
*   **Monitoring & Orchestration Services (Runtime):**
    *   High-level Skyscope OS AI orchestrator agents (themselves SILA ASAs) may use Meta-SILA capabilities to:
        *   Monitor the health, resource usage, policy compliance, and contract adherence of running SILA modules and ASAs.
        *   Dynamically adapt system behavior by deploying new/updated SILA policies or, in very controlled scenarios, by requesting reconfiguration of SILA ASA ensembles via authorized administrative SILA IPC.
    *   Fault diagnosis and automated recovery procedures will be implemented as SILA ASAs that use Meta-SILA to understand system state.

## 9. Future Considerations
*   **Domain-Specific SILA Extensions (DSLs):** Further research into a verifiable framework for creating domain-specific extensions (e.g., for advanced AI model definitions, specialized PQC protocols, real-time system guarantees) that are syntactically distinct but compile down to core, verifiable SILA semantic graphs.
*   **Hardware Acceleration for SILA Runtime & PQC:** Continued investigation into co-designing hardware features that could accelerate common SILA runtime operations, capability checks, PQC cryptography, or even aspects of SILA graph execution.
*   **Advanced Self-Modifying SILA (Highly Restricted & Verifiable):** Deep research into extremely restricted and formally verifiable mechanisms for top-tier SILA orchestrator ASAs to adapt core system SILA graphs in response to unforeseen, critical situations. This would require proving that such modifications cannot violate fundamental security and stability invariants, likely involving dynamic re-verification by embedded SILA Verifier components. This remains highly speculative and a long-term research goal.
*   **Cross-SILA-Version Interoperability & Translation:** Formalizing mechanisms and automated ADK tools for ensuring (or safely failing) interoperability between SILA modules compiled with different major/minor versions of the language, potentially including verifiable SILA-to-SILA graph translation for specific backward/forward compatibility scenarios.
*   **Ethical AI Governance Framework for SILA Generation:** Defining policies and oversight mechanisms for the AI agents that generate SILA code, to ensure their behavior aligns with overall system safety and ethical guidelines.

## V0.2.0 Conclusion
This V0.2.0 specification for SILA culminates the initial four-iteration refinement process. It details a language paradigm engineered for AI-driven development of an extremely secure (PQC min 4096-bit), formally verifiable, and resilient operating system. Key enhancements in this final iteration include the introduction of controlled Meta-SILA/Reflection capabilities, a more detailed vision for high-level AI agent intent translation into SILA graphs via a Goal-Oriented Synthesis Engine in the ADK, and clearer integration points with the broader Skyscope OS AI Pipeline and runtime monitoring services. SILA V0.2.0 provides a robust and innovative linguistic foundation for the subsequent stages of Skyscope OS component design and implementation by AI agent teams.The file `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements, marking the culmination of the 4-iteration refinement process.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 4 and the overall Task Block 0.1. The next step is to report this completion.

**Subject: Stage 3 Task Block 4 - SILA Integration & Container Security Policy V0.1**

**To: Lead Security Analyst**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 3 - Integration & Containerization (in SILA)**
**Phase: 3.3 - Security & Synthesis**

**Directive:**

Building upon the `Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1` from Stage 2, and in light of the emerging Stage 3 designs for core component integration and SILA-based containerization, your task is to oversee your expanded team of specialist AI agents (including SILA Communication Security Agents, Container Security Specialists, Formal Verification Policy Agents, PQC Compliance Experts, etc.) to produce the **`SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1`**.

This document will establish specific security policies and formal verification targets for the integrated SILA ecosystem and the new containerization model.

**Key Requirements for the `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1`:**

1.  **Security Policies for Integrated SILA IPC:**
    *   Define security policies for the detailed SILA IPC protocols used in Microkernel-SKYAIFS and Pipeline-Microkernel interactions. This includes:
        *   Ensuring data integrity and confidentiality (leveraging SILA's PQC-aware types and secure channel concepts).
        *   Preventing denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities within these SILA IPC mechanisms.
        *   Policies for capability validation and rights checking at each interaction point.

2.  **SILA Containerization Security Policies:**
    *   **Isolation Guarantees:** Define policies to ensure robust isolation between SILA containers. This includes preventing unauthorized access to memory, capabilities, or IPC channels of other containers or the host Microkernel.
    *   **Namespace Security:** Policies for the secure implementation and enforcement of SILA-emulated namespaces (PID, Mount, Network, IPC, User).
    *   **Resource Management Security:** Policies to prevent resource exhaustion attacks originating from or targeting SILA containers (e.g., "noisy neighbor" scenarios). This includes secure enforcement of CPU, memory, and I/O quotas defined via SILA capabilities.
    *   **SILA Container Image Security:** Policies for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of SILA container images, including PQC signing of images and their manifests. Define secure practices for storing and distributing these images via the AI Pipeline's module repository.
    *   **Secure Inter-Container Communication:** Define policies for how SILA IPC between containers is authorized and mediated by the Microkernel, including default-deny stances and explicit capability grants for communication.

3.  **Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers:**
    *   Identify critical SILA modules, interfaces, or logic within the integrated component designs and the containerization framework that require formal verification. Examples:
        *   *"The SILA IPC protocol between SKYAIFS and Microkernel for raw block I/O must formally guarantee data integrity and prevent unauthorized capability flow."*
        *   *"The SILA Microkernel mechanisms enforcing container memory isolation must be formally verified against a specified isolation model."*
        *   *"The SILA logic for namespace separation within a container must be formally proven to prevent information leakage to other containers or the host."*
    *   These requirements should be precise enough to guide AI agents using the SILA Verifier tool.

4.  **PQC Application in Integrated Systems:**
    *   Reaffirm and detail the application of PQC (min. 4096-bit equivalent security) for securing all inter-component SILA communication channels (if not inherently protected by kernel-mediated IPC), container images, and any persistent state related to container configuration or management.

5.  **Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS:**
    *   Update the Skyscope OS threat model to include potential vulnerabilities arising from component integration points and the introduction of SILA-based containerization (e.g., inter-container attacks, vulnerabilities in namespace emulation, attacks on the container image lifecycle).
    *   Propose SILA-based mitigation strategies for these new threats.

**Orchestration & Collaboration:**

*   Direct your specialist AI agent teams to analyze the Stage 3 integration and containerization designs from other teams and develop appropriate security policies and verification targets.
*   Collaborate closely with the Microkernel Architect, Filesystem Engineer, AI Pipeline Specialist, and Containerization Expert to ensure security policies are practical and integrated into their designs.

**Output Format:**

*   An updated and comprehensive security policy document (Markdown or similar).

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1` to the designated shared secure repository. This will be a key input for the Stage 3 synthesis.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

Ensuring the security of our integrated SILA components and the new containerization model is paramount for the overall trustworthiness of Skyscope OS.

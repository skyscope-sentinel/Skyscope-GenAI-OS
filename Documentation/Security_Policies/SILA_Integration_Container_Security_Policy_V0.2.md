**This Version (V0.2.0) Goals:** Consolidate all previous iterations, detail policies for auditing/monitoring and a conceptual SILA-based incident response framework, ensure overall coherence, and finalize as a V0.2 policy document. PQC min 4096-bit equivalent security (e.g., NIST PQC Level V algorithms like Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) is baseline.

## 1. Introduction
Retained and updated from Iteration 3. This V0.2.0 document represents the definitive security policy framework governing the integration of core SILA components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline) and the OS-level SILA containerization model within Skyscope OS. It is the culmination of four iterations of AI co-op driven design and refinement, ensuring deep alignment with SILA V0.2, the V0.2 designs of related OS components, and the project's foundational principle of PQC-first security (min 4096-bit equivalent). This policy aims to be actionable for AI agent developers using the SILA ADK and verifiable by the SILA toolchain.

## 2. Security Policies for Integrated SILA IPC
Consolidated and refined from Iteration 3. Key policies include:
*   **IS-IPC-001 (Data Integrity & Confidentiality):** Mandates PQC encryption (e.g., `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<MLKEM_1024, MessageRecord>`) and PQC authentication (e.g., MLDSA_5 signatures on message wrappers or AEAD modes) for SILA IPC channels traversing less trusted boundaries or as defined by data sensitivity.
*   **IS-IPC-002 (Capability Validation):** Receiving SILA ASAs **must** validate type, rights, and scope of embedded SILA capabilities against `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s.
*   **IS-IPC-003 (DoS Resistance):** SILA Endpoints for critical services **must** implement rate limiting, fair queuing, and resource usage monitoring, governed by `SILA_EndpointPolicy_Record`s.

## 3. SILA Containerization Security Policies
Consolidated and refined from Iteration 3. Key policies include:
*   **CS-ISO-001 (Default Deny Inter-Container Access):** Strict default denial of all inter-container interactions unless explicitly mediated and authorized by the "System_ContainerInterlink_ASA" based on PQC-signed policies.
*   **CS-NS-001 (Namespace Integrity & Verification):** SILA logic for namespace emulation (PID, Mount, Network, IPC, User) **must** be formally verified to prevent leakage or interference.
*   **CS-RES-001 (Strict Resource Quota Enforcement):** Microkernel SILA operations **must** strictly enforce container resource quotas defined in its `SILA_ContainerResourcePolicy_Bundle_Record_Type` capability.
*   **CS-IMG-001 (Container Image Authenticity & Integrity Chain):** Multi-stage PQC signature verification for `SILA_ContainerImage_Bundle_Record`s and their constituent SILA modules by both AI Pipeline and Microkernel.

## 4. Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers
Consolidated and refined from Iteration 3. Key targets include:
*   Microkernel ResourceLockManager_ASA logic (FV-INT-001).
*   Container Interlink ASA channel setup protocol and policy enforcement (FV-CON-001).
*   Microkernel PID Namespace filtering and isolation logic (FV-CON-002).
*   Capability Confinement within Containers (from Stage 2/3).
*   Resource Quota Enforcement by Microkernel (from Stage 2/3).
*   Information Flow Control between containers (from Iteration 3).

## 5. PQC Application in Integrated Systems
Consolidated from Iteration 3. Reaffirms the mandatory use of PQC algorithms achieving at least NIST PQC Level V (min 4096-bit equivalent security) for all cryptographic operations. SILA V0.2's PQC-aware types and cryptographic primitives are central to this.

## 6. Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS
Consolidated from Iteration 3. Key threats include TV-INT-001 (Compromise of Core Integration ASA), TV-INT-002 (SILA IPC Replay/Spoofing), TV-INT-003 (Resource Exhaustion via Shared Integration Service), and TV-CONT-001 (Container Breakout via Kernel Exploit). Mitigations rely on formal verification of critical SILA ASAs/modules, strict capability discipline, robust PQC usage, and the new auditing/incident response framework.

## 7. Security Policies for Dynamic Module Management
Consolidated from Iteration 3 (DM-AUTH-001, DM-STATE-001, DM-RES-001, DM-CONT-001). These ensure authorized, secure (PQC state migration), and resource-controlled updates of SILA modules.

## 8. SILA Contracts for Security Enforcement
Consolidated from Iteration 3. `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s are mandated for all critical ASAs and Microkernel operations, specifying security invariants, pre/postconditions for operations, and references to applicable `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s.

## 9. Deep Compression Security Integration Policies
Consolidated from Iteration 3 (DC-INT-001 for end-to-end PQC integrity via multi-stage hash verification, DC-RES-001 for resource limits on DC service, DC-PQC-001 for PQC-signed metadata security).

## 10. Security Policies for SILA ADK Usage
Consolidated from Iteration 3 (ADK-SEC-001: Mandatory Formal Verification Pre-Commit; ADK-SEC-002: Secure Capability Handling Patterns; ADK-SEC-003: PQC Usage Compliance; ADK-SEC-004: AI Pipeline Enforcement & Re-Verification).

## 11. PQC Key Management for Containerized SILA Services
Consolidated from Iteration 3 (PQC-CONT-001: Unique Container Instance Identity & Signing Keys; PQC-CONT-002: Ephemeral PQC Session Key Provisioning via KeyVault ASA; PQC-CONT-003: Strict Isolation of Private Key Material).

## 12. Auditing and Monitoring for Integrated/Containerized SILA Systems (New Section - Elaboration for V0.2.0)

*   **Policy AUDIT-001 (Comprehensive & Verifiable Event Logging - V0.2 Update):**
    *   All security-significant operations across integrated components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline, Container Services) and within containers (if policy dictates for critical containerized ASAs) **must** generate structured audit events.
    *   This includes: SILA capability lifecycle events (creation, derivation with new rights, attempted misuse, revocation), IPC connection establishment/teardown across defined security boundaries (e.g., inter-container, container-to-host), process/container creation/destruction, resource allocation denials due to quota, detected hardware faults with security implications, PQC key management operations (requests, derivations, revocations by KeyVault ASA), policy enforcement decisions by mediating ASAs (e.g., `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA` allowing/denying a channel), and significant actions by system-level AI bots (e.g., SKYAIFS data relocation, Deep Compression algorithm selection by ASB_Analyzer).
*   **Policy AUDIT-002 (Standardized SILA Audit Record with PQC Integrity - V0.2 Update):**
    *   Audit events **must** use a standardized `SILA_Universal_AuditEvent_Record` structure (extending the `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record` concept from SKYAIFS V0.2 for system-wide applicability). As per `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`, this SILA Record **must** include: `event_id: SILA_UniqueID_String`, `event_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String`, `timestamp_from_trusted_source_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_SignedTimestamp_Object>`, `source_sila_agent_identity_cap_fingerprint: SILA_CapFingerprint_Type`, `target_resource_or_object_cap_fingerprint_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapFingerprint_Type>`, `operation_name_string: SILA_String_Record`, `operation_outcome_enum: SILA_OperationOutcome_Enum`, `detailed_parameters_sila_map_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_Map_Record<SILA_String_Record, SILA_Any_Record>>`, `policy_evaluation_details_cap_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PolicyEvaluationTrace_Record>>`, and crucially, a `record_pqc_signature: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5_SILA_Enum>`.
    *   This PQC signature **must** be generated by the SILA ASA logging the event, using a PQC signing key capability authorized for audit logging for that component.
*   **Policy AUDIT-003 (Secure & Resilient Log Storage & Forwarding - V0.2 Update):**
    *   Generated `SILA_Universal_AuditEvent_Record`s **must** be sent via secure SILA IPC (PQC-encrypted and authenticated channels) to a dedicated, highly trusted "System_AuditLogManager_ASA".
    *   This manager ASA **must** store these PQC-signed audit logs in a PQC-signed, append-only, and integrity-protected manner. This storage will likely utilize SKYAIFS with specific security policies designed for high-assurance archival log storage (e.g., versioned, immutable log segments).
    *   Access to query or retrieve audit logs via the `System_AuditLogManager_ASA`'s SILA interface is strictly controlled by SILA capabilities, granted only to authorized system monitoring, forensic AI agents, or human administrator interface ASAs (under multi-factor PQC authentication).
*   **Policy AUDIT-004 (Real-time Monitoring Hooks & Alerting - V0.2 Update):**
    *   Critical SILA ASAs (Microkernel security event dispatcher, SKYAIFS Supervisor, Container Supervisor, CSO_ASA) **must** provide secure SILA IPC endpoints for authorized "Realtime_SecurityInformation_Monitor_ASA" instances to subscribe to streams of specific, high-priority audit event types or `SILA_SecurityAlert_Event_Record`s. This enables immediate analysis, correlation, and potential intervention.

## 13. Conceptual Incident Response Framework (SILA-based - New Section for V0.2.0)

*   **Standardized SILA Security Alert Format (SILA V0.2 Aligned):**
    *   All security detection mechanisms (e.g., Microkernel fault handler for security violations like capability misuse; SKYAIFS `DataExfiltrationDetectionBot_ASA`; container isolation fault detectors; PQC validation failures in any component; policy compliance failures detected by runtime checks) **must** generate a standardized `SILA_SecurityAlert_Event_Record`.
    *   `SILA_SecurityAlert_Event_Record { // SILA Record
          alert_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          alert_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String,
          severity_level_enum: SILA_AlertSeverity_Enum {Informational, Low, Medium, High, Critical_SystemImpact},
          generating_agent_identity_cap_fingerprint: SILA_CapFingerprint_Type, // Authenticated source
          suspected_target_object_caps_array_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_Array<SILA_CapToken<SILA_Any_Type>>>, // Capabilities to objects involved
          alert_type_classification_string: SILA_String_Record, // e.g., "PQC_SignatureVerification_Failure", "Container_Isolation_Bypass_Attempt", "Anomalous_SILA_IPC_Pattern"
          detailed_evidence_bundle_cap_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Signed_DataBlob_Object_Type>>, // Capability to a PQC-signed bundle of detailed evidence (logs, state snapshots)
          event_occurrence_timestamp_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_SignedTimestamp_Object>,
          recommended_response_plan_id_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_String_Record>, // Hint for CSO_ASA
          alert_pqc_signature: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5_SILA_Enum> // Signed by the alerting ASA
        }`.
*   **Central Security Orchestrator SILA ASA (CSO_ASA):**
    *   This highly privileged SILA ASA (itself formally verified to the highest possible standard and heavily sandboxed by the Microkernel) is the designated recipient for all `SILA_SecurityAlert_Event_Record`s from across the OS.
    *   It maintains a "SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Registry_ASA" (a PQC-signed, capability-controlled database ASA). This registry stores `SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Graph_Cap` capabilities – these are capabilities to executable SILA semantic graphs representing predefined response plans, indexed by alert type, severity, and system state.
*   **SILA-based Automated Response Plan Execution:**
    1.  `CSO_ASA` receives a `SILA_SecurityAlert_Event_Record`. It first verifies its PQC signature and assesses its authenticity and severity.
    2.  It queries the `SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Registry_ASA` using the alert's characteristics to retrieve the appropriate `SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Graph_Cap`.
    3.  The `CSO_ASA` then instantiates and executes this SILA response plan graph. The plan itself is a SILA program that can perform actions like:
        *   `SILA_Microkernel_IsolateContainer_Op(target_container_cap_from_alert)`
        *   `SILA_Microkernel_RevokeCapability_Globally_Op(compromised_capability_fingerprint_from_alert)`
        *   `SILA_SKYAIFS_TriggerForensicSnapshot_Op(target_file_or_metadata_cap_from_alert)`
        *   `SILA_SystemNotification_Service_SendSecureAlert_Op(human_administrator_alert_sila_record_cap)`
        *   `SILA_AI_Pipeline_TriggerModuleQuarantine_Op(compromised_module_id_from_alert)`
        *   Requesting PQC key rotation for potentially compromised keys via the `System_KeyVault_ASA`.
*   **Policy IR-001 (Verifiable & Authorized Response Plans - V0.2 Update):** All `SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Graph`s stored in the registry **must** be PQC-signed by a "SecurityPolicyAuthority_ASA". Furthermore, critical response plans **must** be formally verified by the SILA Verifier to ensure they execute as intended, only use authorized capabilities, and do not cause unintended system disruption or escalation of privilege.
*   **Policy IR-002 (Least Privilege for CSO_ASA Responses - V0.2 Update):** The `CSO_ASA` itself operates under the principle of least privilege. The capabilities it uses to execute response plan actions (e.g., to isolate a container, revoke another capability) must be distinct, granular, and only activated for the duration of that specific response action, as defined within the SILA response plan graph itself. SILA's Meta-SILA/Reflection capabilities might be used by the CSO_ASA (if granted the capability to do so) to assess system state before acting.

## 14. Future Considerations for Security Policy
*   **AI-Driven Predictive Security Policy Adaptation:** Exploring how the `CSO_ASA` or other high-level AI security orchestrators could learn from incident patterns and system telemetry (PQC-signed audit logs) to proactively propose (for human or designated super-AI agent approval) modifications or additions to `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s, `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s, or `SILA_IncidentResponsePlan_Graph`s to improve future system resilience and defense posture.
*   **Formal Proof of System-Wide Security Invariants under Policy:** Extending the SILA Verifier's capabilities to formally prove that a collection of integrated SILA modules, operating under their specified contracts and the global security policies defined herein, upholds critical system-wide security invariants (e.g., "no user data from a container marked 'TopSecret' can ever be written to a SKYAIFS storage area marked 'PublicNetwork_Accessible'").
*   **PQC Agility & Post-Compromise Recovery Protocols (SILA-Defined):** Developing detailed SILA-based protocols and automated procedures for migrating the entire Skyscope OS and its data to new PQC algorithms in the event that a currently deployed PQC algorithm is found to be cryptographically broken. This includes secure mechanisms for re-establishing trust and re-keying all system components and data after a significant PQC-related cryptographic compromise.
*   **Ethical AI Behavior Governance for Security ASAs:** Defining `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s and `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s for AI-driven security ASAs (like CSO_ASA, Exfiltration Detection Bots) that not only govern their operational security but also include rules to prevent unintended harmful actions or biases in their security decisions.

## V0.2.0 Conclusion
The `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.2.0` provides a definitive and comprehensive security framework for Skyscope OS's integrated SILA components and its novel OS-level containerization model. This final iteration from Phase 0 refinement has introduced crucial policies for system-wide, PQC-signed auditing and monitoring, and has conceptualized a verifiable, SILA-based incident response framework orchestrated by a Central Security Orchestrator ASA. It consistently reinforces the commitment to PQC minimum 4096-bit equivalent security, the deep integration of formal verification for critical SILA logic (guided by SILA contracts), and secure AI agent development practices via ADK policies. This V0.2.0 policy document is an essential cornerstone for guiding the secure design, SILA implementation, and future evolution of all Skyscope OS functionalities, aiming to create an operating system with an unparalleled, verifiable security posture.The file `Documentation/Security_Policies/SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.2.md` has been successfully created with the specified content, marking the culmination of the 4-iteration refinement process for this specification.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 4 and the overall Task Block 3.4. The next step is to report this completion.

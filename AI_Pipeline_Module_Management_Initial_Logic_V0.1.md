# AI Pipeline & Module Management Initial Logic V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document presents the initial architectural logic for the Skyscope OS AI Pipeline and Distributed Module Management System. It aims to define how AI capabilities are integrated and how all OS components are managed.

## 2. Modular AI Principles
The design of AI modules within Skyscope OS will adhere to the following core principles:

*   **Module Independence:** Each AI module should be self-contained, focusing on a specific capability (e.g., predictive filesystem caching, generative UI elements, anomaly detection). Modules should have minimal direct dependencies on the internal state of other AI modules.
*   **Standardized Inputs/Outputs (I/O):** Modules will interact through well-defined data formats and APIs (likely leveraging the OS's core IPC mechanisms). This ensures interoperability and allows for easier replacement or updating of modules.
*   **Independent Development & Testing:** The modular structure facilitates parallel development efforts by different teams or specialists. Each module can be tested in isolation before integration.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture should allow individual AI modules or their underlying resource allocations (compute, memory) to be scaled independently based on demand or system resource availability.

## 3. AI-Driven Dependency Management (Initial Concepts)
The AI pipeline will play a crucial role in intelligently managing dependencies across the OS:

*   **Scope of Dependencies:**
    *   Dependencies between traditional OS software modules (e.g., a library required by a user-space driver).
    *   Dependencies between different AI models (e.g., an NLP model output being the input for a decision-making model).
    *   Dependencies of AI models on specific versions of datasets, data schemas, or hardware accelerators.
*   **AI for Mapping & Resolution:**
    *   The system will explore using AI techniques (e.g., machine learning based on parsing module manifests, analyzing historical build data, code repository analysis) to automatically map, identify conflicts, and suggest resolutions for dependencies.
    *   This can help in ensuring compatibility during updates and deployments, and potentially predicting integration issues.
    *   The goal is to move beyond simple declared dependencies to a more intelligent understanding of module interplay.

## 4. Distributed Module Management System Architecture

### 4.1. Versioning Strategy
*   A consistent versioning scheme, likely **Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0)**, will be applied to all OS components. This includes the microkernel, user-space services, AI models, UI assets, libraries, and applications.
*   This ensures clarity in managing updates, dependencies, and rollbacks.

### 4.2. Secure Distribution
*   All versioned software and AI modules must be **digitally signed using PQC algorithms** (e.g., ML-DSA, FALCON, as specified by the Filesystem/Security PQC protocol).
*   The Skyscope OS loader and module management services **must cryptographically verify these signatures** before any module is loaded, executed, or integrated into the system. Unsigned or invalidly signed modules will be rejected.

### 4.3. Module Repository
*   A secure, PQC-protected repository (or a distributed network of repositories, potentially leveraging peer-to-peer technologies for resilience) will be used for storing and retrieving all versioned OS modules.
*   Access control mechanisms will be enforced to manage who can publish or update modules.
*   The repository will store modules along with their metadata, including version, dependencies, and PQC signatures.

This V0.1 definition provides the foundational concepts. Future iterations will detail the specific APIs, data formats, AI models for dependency management, and the precise architecture of the distributed repository.

**Subject: Stage 2 Task - SILA Microkernel Internals Design V0.1**

**To: Microkernel Architect**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 2 - Core Component Development (in SILA)**
**Iteration: 1**

**Directive:**

Building upon the `Microkernel SILA Design Specification V0.1` from Stage 1, your task is to produce the **SILA Microkernel Internals Design V0.1**. This document must provide a more granular and detailed exposition of the microkernel's internal structures and operational logic as they would be implemented using **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)**.

**Key Requirements for the SILA Microkernel Internals Design:**

1.  **Detailed SILA Data Structures:**
    *   Define the conceptual SILA semantic graph structures for key kernel objects:
        *   Thread Control Blocks (TCBs): Include fields for registers (represented as SILA PQC-protected structures), scheduling parameters, state, links to capability spaces, and fault handler endpoints.
        *   Capability Spaces (CSpaces and CNodes): Detail their SILA representation, including how capability tokens are stored and managed within these structures.
        *   Endpoints and Notification Objects: SILA structures for IPC synchronization primitives.
        *   Address Space Descriptors (e.g., Page Tables/Trees): How these are represented in SILA, including PQC-protection for critical entries and links to frame capabilities.
    *   Specify PQC protection attributes for all sensitive fields within these SILA structures.

2.  **SILA Semantic Graph Logic for Critical Operations:**
    *   Provide conceptual representations of the SILA semantic graph logic for core microkernel operations. This is not raw SILA 'code' but a description of the flow and manipulation of SILA objects and capabilities:
        *   **Context Switching:** Logic for saving and restoring TCB state (SILA register structures).
        *   **IPC Message Transfer:** SILA graph flow for `Send`, `Receive`, `Call`, `Reply`, including capability invocation, message buffer handling (as SILA PQC-aware structures), and thread synchronization.
        *   **Capability Derivation & Revocation:** SILA logic for `Cap_Copy`, `Cap_Mint`, `Cap_Revoke`, showing how new capability tokens are created or invalidated.
        *   **Memory Mapping:** SILA graph logic for `AddressSpace_Map` and `AddressSpace_Unmap`, including updates to SILA address space descriptor structures.
    *   Illustrate how SILA's concurrency and event constructs are used.

3.  **Fault Handling Mechanisms in SILA:**
    *   Describe how hardware exceptions (e.g., page faults, undefined instructions, capability violations detected by hardware assists) are trapped by the lowest levels of SILA execution.
    *   Detail the SILA event/state machine constructs used to process these faults and dispatch them to registered SILA-based fault handler routines or endpoints associated with TCBs.

4.  **Bootstrapping a SILA-based Microkernel:**
    *   Outline the conceptual sequence for initializing the microkernel when its core logic is itself compiled SILA code. This includes:
        *   Initial setup of SILA runtime environment by a minimal (potentially non-SILA or ROM-based SILA) bootloader.
        *   Creation of initial kernel objects (TCBs, CSpaces, memory objects) using foundational SILA primitives.
        *   Verification of core SILA kernel modules (if applicable) using PQC signatures and SILA Verifier logic.

5.  **Refined SILA Interfaces for SKYAIFS & Deep Compression:**
    *   Based on Stage 1 designs, provide more detailed SILA interface definitions (operation signatures, parameter types as SILA structures) for the privileged microkernel operations required by SKYAIFS and the Deep Compression service.

**Output Format:**

*   A detailed design document (Markdown or similar) describing the microkernel's internal logic, data structures, and core operational flows in terms of SILA concepts and semantic graph representations.
*   Focus on the "how" â€“ how SILA constructs would be used to build these kernel mechanisms.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'SILA Microkernel Internals Design V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

This detailed internal design is crucial for understanding the feasibility and specifics of implementing the Skyscope OS microkernel in SILA.

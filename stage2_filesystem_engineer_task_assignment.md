**Subject: Stage 2 Task - SKYAIFS Detailed SILA Logic V0.1**

**To: Filesystem Engineer**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 2 - Core Component Development (in SILA)**
**Iteration: 1**

**Directive:**

Building upon the `SKYAIFS SILA Implementation Plan V0.1` from Stage 1, your task is to produce the **SKYAIFS Detailed SILA Logic V0.1**. This document must provide a more granular description of SKYAIFS's internal operations, AI bot behaviors, and data management processes, all expressed in terms of **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)** constructs and semantic graph logic.

**Key Requirements for the SKYAIFS Detailed SILA Logic:**

1.  **Detailed SILA Logic for AI Bot Operations:**
    *   For each type of SKYAIFS AI bot (defragmentation, data relocation, predictive placement, integrity verification), provide conceptual representations of their core SILA semantic graph logic.
    *   This includes:
        *   Decision-making processes (e.g., how a relocation bot decides which data to move based on threat intelligence received via SILA IPC).
        *   Interaction with SKYAIFS metadata (SILA graph structures).
        *   Invocation of microkernel or Deep Compression services via SILA calls.
        *   Use of SILA state machines to manage bot states and SILA concurrent constructs for parallel operations.

2.  **SILA Semantic Graph Logic for Metadata Management:**
    *   Detail the conceptual SILA graph logic for fundamental filesystem metadata operations:
        *   Creating new file/directory SILA metadata structures (including PQC protection and versioning).
        *   Reading and interpreting existing SILA metadata structures.
        *   Immutably updating metadata (creating new SILA graph versions).
        *   Deleting file/directory metadata and managing associated resources (e.g., revoking capabilities, freeing blocks via SILA calls to allocation managers).
    *   Illustrate how PQC signing and verification are integrated into these SILA metadata operations.

3.  **I/O Path Implementation in SILA:**
    *   Describe the conceptual SILA logic for handling file read and write operations:
        *   Translating a high-level SILA file operation (e.g., `SKYAIFS_ReadFile_SILA_Call`) into interactions with SKYAIFS metadata to locate data blocks.
        *   Managing data buffers (as SILA PQC-aware structures).
        *   Interacting with the Deep Compression service (via SILA calls) if transparent compression/decompression is active for the file.
        *   Requesting data block reads/writes from the microkernel's raw storage interface (via SILA capability calls).
    *   Show how SILA's event-driven or asynchronous features handle I/O completion.

4.  **Detailed PQC Operations within SILA Workflows:**
    *   Elaborate on how specific PQC operations (encryption/decryption with ML-KEM >=4096-bit, signing/verification with ML-DSA >=4096-bit) are invoked as SILA graph operations at various stages:
        *   Encrypting/decrypting file content blocks.
        *   Signing/verifying metadata structures.
        *   Generating/verifying checksums for data integrity within SKYAIFS.
    *   Specify how SILA's PQC-aware types and capability system ensure correct and secure usage of cryptographic keys.

**Output Format:**

*   A detailed design document (Markdown or similar) describing SKYAIFS's internal logic for AI bot operations, metadata management, and I/O paths, using SILA concepts and semantic graph representations.
*   Focus on the detailed "how-to" of implementing these features with SILA.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'SKYAIFS Detailed SILA Logic V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

This detailed SILA-based design for SKYAIFS will be crucial for developing a truly intelligent and secure filesystem for Skyscope OS.

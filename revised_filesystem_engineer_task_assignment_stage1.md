**Subject: Revised Stage 1 Task - SKYAIFS SILA Implementation Plan V0.1**

**To: Filesystem Engineer**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 1 (Revised) - Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design**
**Iteration: 1 (Post-Stage 0)**

**Directive:**

Following the conceptualization of SKYAIFS and the SILA programming language in Stage 0, your task is to produce the **SKYAIFS SILA Implementation Plan V0.1**. This document will outline how the SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem) will be designed and implemented using **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)**.

**Key Requirements for the SILA-based Implementation Plan:**

1.  **SILA Data Structures for SKYAIFS:**
    *   Define the conceptual SILA data structures that will represent SKYAIFS metadata. This includes structures for inodes (or their SILA equivalent), directory organization, allocation bitmaps (or equivalent for dynamic blocks), and Merkle trees.
    *   Specify how these SILA structures will incorporate PQC protection (minimum 4096-bit, unique keys) as defined in their types (e.g., `Encrypted<ML-KEM_4096, SKYAIFS_Metadata_Block>`).
    *   Address how versioning and immutability of core metadata will be handled using SILA constructs.
    *   Describe how variable-sized logical blocks are represented and managed.

2.  **AI Bot Orchestration in SILA:**
    *   Outline how the AI bots responsible for SKYAIFS operations (defragmentation, data relocation, predictive placement, integrity verification) will be implemented or controlled using SILA.
    *   Consider SILA's features for concurrency, event handling, and policy-driven execution in designing the bot interaction and control mechanisms.

3.  **SILA-Defined Interfaces:**
    *   Specify the conceptual SILA interfaces SKYAIFS will expose to other OS components (e.g., applications, module manager).
    *   Detail the SILA interfaces SKYAIFS will use to interact with the SILA-based microkernel (for storage access, memory, IPC).
    *   Describe how SKYAIFS will interface with or utilize the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism (e.g., for transparently compressing/decompressing file data).

4.  **PQC Application within SILA Structures:**
    *   Reconfirm how PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, etc., with a focus on >=4096-bit security) are applied to specific SILA data structures and operations within SKYAIFS, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

**Output Format:**

*   A conceptual design document (Markdown or similar) detailing SKYAIFS's implementation strategy using SILA. This includes descriptions of SILA data structures, bot control logic, and interface definitions at a conceptual level.
*   Actual SILA 'code' generation is not expected at this V0.1 specification stage.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'SKYAIFS SILA Implementation Plan V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

This plan is crucial for translating the SKYAIFS concept into a tangible, SILA-based design, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the Skyscope OS architecture.

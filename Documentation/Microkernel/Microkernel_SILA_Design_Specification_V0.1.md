# Microkernel SILA Design Specification V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Skyscope OS Microkernel architecture, revised to be implemented using the **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)**. This transition leverages SILA's AI-centric design, verifiability, and embedded security features to realize a truly next-generation microkernel.

## 2. Core Services in SILA

### 2.1. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
*   **SILA Primitives:** IPC operations (`Send`, `Receive`, `Call`, `Reply`) will be represented as fundamental operations within SILA's semantic graph.
*   **Capability Tokens:** Endpoint capabilities will be first-class `CapabilityToken` types in SILA, passed as parameters to these IPC graph nodes.
*   **Message Structure:** Message data will utilize SILA's PQC-aware structures (e.g., `SILA_Encrypted<User_Message_Payload>`) ensuring type safety and cryptographic protection where specified.
*   **Invocation:** An AI agent would construct a SILA graph segment representing, for example, a `Call` operation, linking the target endpoint capability, the message data structure, and a placeholder for the reply.

### 2.2. Memory Management
*   **`Untyped_Retype` in SILA:** This operation becomes a SILA graph node taking an `UntypedMemory_CapabilityToken` and parameters for `object_type` and `size_bits`. It outputs a new `CapabilityToken` for the created kernel object (e.g., `Endpoint_CapabilityToken`). The types of these tokens are distinct in SILA.
*   **`AddressSpace_Map` in SILA:** A SILA operation node taking an `AddressSpace_CapabilityToken`, virtual address, a `Frame_CapabilityToken`, and SILA structures representing rights and attributes. Its success is contingent on the validity and rights of the passed capability tokens.
*   **PQC-Aware Frames:** Memory frame capabilities can be associated with SILA types that specify PQC protection status if the memory is intended for specific pre-encrypted data.

### 2.3. Scheduling and Thread Management
*   **TCBs as SILA Objects:** Thread Control Blocks (TCBs) will be represented as SILA objects, managed via capability tokens. Their internal structure (e.g., registers, state) can be defined using SILA's secure record types.
*   **`SchedControl_Configure` in SILA:** This involves a SILA operation that takes a `SchedulingContext_CapabilityToken` and a `TCB_CapabilityToken`, along with SILA structures for budget, period, etc. SILA's event constructs can be used to signal scheduling events or policy changes.
*   **Thread Lifecycle:** Operations like `TCB_Resume` or `TCB_Suspend` are SILA graph nodes acting on `TCB_CapabilityToken`s.

### 2.4. Capability System
*   **Native SILA Tokens:** SILA's `CapabilityToken` primitive type is the foundation. These are unforgeable references managed by the SILA runtime (which, for the microkernel, is the microkernel itself).
*   **SILA Operations:** `Cap_Copy`, `Cap_Mint`, `Cap_Delete`, `Cap_Revoke` are specific SILA graph operations that manipulate capability tokens within CSpaces (also represented as SILA objects accessible via capabilities). Rights and guards are expressed using SILA's verifiable integer types or policy constructs.

## 3. SILA Leverage for Microkernel Enhancement
*   **Verifiability:** SILA's design for formal verification will allow proving correctness of microkernel operations defined as SILA semantic graphs.
*   **PQC-Aware Types:** By defining kernel data structures with SILA's PQC-aware types (e.g., a TCB having an `Encrypted<PQC_Algo, IPC_Buffer_Pointer>`), security attributes are embedded and verifiable.
*   **Agent-Oriented Design:** AI agents can more effectively reason about, construct, and manage microkernel resources when they are represented as SILA semantic graphs and objects.
*   **Policy-Driven Execution:** SILA's policy constructs can enforce complex security or operational policies directly within the microkernel's logic (e.g., restricting IPC based on dynamically verified data tags).

## 4. SKYAIFS and Deep Compression Support

### 4.1. SKYAIFS Support
*   **Privileged SILA Interfaces:** The microkernel will expose specific, highly privileged SILA operations callable only by SKYAIFS (identified by a unique, unforgeable capability). These include:
    *   `Microkernel_Request_RawStorage_Capability(device_id, &storage_cap_token)`
    *   `Microkernel_Report_Storage_Fault(storage_cap_token, fault_details_sila_structure)`
*   **Fault Reporting Channels:** SILA event constructs or dedicated secure endpoints will be used for SKYAIFS to report critical faults to the microkernel or a designated system monitor.

### 4.2. Deep Compression Support
*   **Module Loading Awareness:** During boot or module loading, if a SILA module is identified (via metadata) as being deeply compressed, the microkernel will invoke a trusted SILA-based Deep Compression service.
*   **Memory Management for Decompression:** The microkernel will allocate secure memory regions (via SILA capability grants) for the Deep Compression service to use during on-demand decompression of SILA modules.
*   **Early Boot:** Core microkernel components, if themselves deeply compressed, would require a minimal, trusted bootloader with integrated Deep Compression capabilities (potentially a ROM-based SILA interpreter stub).

## 5. Runtime Immutability in a SILA Context
*   **MMU/MPU Protection:** The compiled SILA binary representing the microkernel's core code and immutable data structures will be loaded into memory regions marked as read-only by the MMU/MPU, configured by the early boot process.
*   **SILA Binary Integrity:** The SILA binary itself will have its overall integrity protected by a PQC signature, verified at boot.
*   **SILA Metadata:** SILA's rich metadata layer, PQC-signed and associated with the binary, will contain information about immutable sections and their checksums, allowing runtime verification by authorized agents if necessary.
*   **Capability System:** SILA's capability system inherently prevents unauthorized writes to kernel structures, as no SILA operation can proceed without a valid capability granting appropriate rights.

## 6. Formal Verifiability Approach
*   **SILA Design:** The SILA language is designed with constructs that map well to formal methods (e.g., state machines, immutable data, verifiable control flow).
*   **SILA Verifier Tool:** The primary strategy involves using the SILA Verifier tool. This tool will analyze the SILA semantic graphs representing the microkernel's logic and attempt to prove their correctness against formal specifications (also potentially expressed in a SILA-compatible format).
*   **Layered Verification:** Verification will likely be layered, starting with core primitives and building up to more complex services.
*   **Assumptions:** This relies on the verified correctness of the SILA compiler and the SILA Verifier itself, which are separate, critical verification targets.All right, the first document `Microkernel_SILA_Design_Specification_V0.1.md` has been created.

Now, I'll proceed to the second document:

**Subject: Iteration 1 Task - PQC Filesystem Encryption Protocol Specification**

**To: Filesystem Engineer**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 1 - Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design**
**Iteration: 1**

**Directive:**

You are tasked with producing the initial specification for the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) protocols that will be employed in Skyscope OS's unmodifiable, AI-driven filesystem. This specification is crucial for ensuring the long-term security and integrity of user and system data.

**Key Requirements for the Specification:**

1.  **Algorithm Selection and Rationale (as per Table 2 in the master design document):**
    *   **Key Encapsulation/Encryption:**
        *   Primary: ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) - FIPS 203.
        *   Backup/Alternative: HQC - NIST selection (draft expected 2026).
        *   Detail their use for file content encryption and unique per-file/block encryption keys.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**
        *   Primary: ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) - FIPS 204, or FALCON - FIPS 206 (draft).
        *   Alternative: SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) - FIPS 205.
        *   Detail their use for critical filesystem metadata (inodes, directories, allocation bitmaps) and ensuring the integrity of append-only data structures/versioned file content.
    *   **Secure Hash Functions:**
        *   Primary: SHA3-256 / SHA3-512 - FIPS 202.
        *   Discuss their application in constructing Merkle trees for filesystem integrity.
        *   Briefly mention exploration of dedicated PQC hash proposals if standardized and vetted.
    *   For each algorithm, provide a concise rationale for its selection, considering performance, key size, security level, and its role within the filesystem (e.g., data at rest, metadata integrity).

2.  **Application to Filesystem Components:**
    *   Specify how these algorithms will be applied to:
        *   Encrypting file content (mentioning unique per-file/block keys).
        *   Signing filesystem metadata (inode tables, directory structures, etc.).
        *   Ensuring integrity of append-only logs and versioned file content.
        *   Constructing Merkle trees for overall filesystem integrity verification (root hash being PQC-signed).

3.  **Initial Key Management Considerations:**
    *   Briefly outline initial thoughts on PQC key management, including generation, storage (referencing the need for secure vaulting, to be detailed by the Security Analyst), and derivation (e.g., for per-file keys from a master key). This is not a full key management plan but initial architectural considerations.

**Output Format:**

*   A structured document (e.g., Markdown) detailing the PQC choices and their application to the filesystem.
*   This document will be a critical input for the Project Coordinator's synthesis of the unified OS architecture and for the Security Analyst's comprehensive PQC suite definition.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'PQC Filesystem Encryption Protocol Specification V0.1' to the designated shared repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

Please confirm receipt of this task. Your specification will be integrated with designs from the Microkernel Architect and AI Pipeline Specialist.

# SILA Integration & Container Security Policy - V0.1 - Iteration 1

**Based on:** `Documentation/Security_Policies/SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1.md` (initial conceptual placeholder from Stage 3 Task Block 4 assignment)
**Key References (ensure V0.2 alignment where available/emerging):**
*   `Documentation/SILA_Language/SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
*   `Documentation/Microkernel/SILA_Microkernel_SKYAIFS_Integration_Specification_V0.2.md`
*   `Documentation/AI_Pipeline_Module_Management/SILA_Pipeline_Microkernel_Integration_Spec_V0.2.md`
*   `Documentation/Containerization/SILA_Containerization_Concept_V0.2.md`
*   Previous overarching security policies (e.g., `Refined_SILA_Security_Policies_Verification_Reqts_V0.1.md`).

**Iteration Focus:** Initial alignment with V0.2 Stage 3 designs, concrete formal verification examples for integration, threat model update for a new interaction. PQC min 4096-bit equivalent security (e.g., NIST PQC Level V algorithms like Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) is baseline for all cryptographic operations.

## 1. Introduction
This document begins the iterative refinement of security policies specifically for the integrated SILA components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline) and the SILA-based OS-level containerization framework. It aims to ensure that the security posture evolves in lockstep with the V0.2 design specifications of these systems, guided by SILA V0.2's capabilities for verifiable security.

## 2. Security Policies for Integrated SILA IPC

These policies are refined based on the specific SILA IPC protocols detailed in `Documentation/Microkernel/SILA_Microkernel_SKYAIFS_Integration_Specification_V0.2.md` and `Documentation/AI_Pipeline_Module_Management/SILA_Pipeline_Microkernel_Integration_Spec_V0.2.md`.

*   **Policy IS-IPC-001 (Data Integrity & Confidentiality - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   All SILA IPC channels defined for cross-component communication (e.g., SKYAIFS I/O Path ASA to Microkernel Storage Service ASA for block I/O; AI Pipeline's ModuleManager ASA to Microkernel ProcessManager ASA for module loading) must utilize PQC-encrypted payloads if they traverse any boundary not strictly mediated and isolated by a kernel-enforced point-to-point SILA capability channel that itself guarantees confidentiality. (e.g., using `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<MLKEM_1024_SILA_Enum, SILA_MessagePayload_Record_Type>`).
    *   Message authenticity and integrity for such channels must be ensured via PQC signatures (e.g., MLDSA_5) on message wrappers or by leveraging authenticated encryption modes within SILA's PQC primitives, if not implicitly provided by the underlying secure SILA channel primitive specified in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`.
*   **Policy IS-IPC-002 (Capability Validation in IPC - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   The receiving SILA ASA of any SILA IPC call **must** rigorously validate the type, rights, and intended scope of any embedded SILA capabilities within the received message against its operational requirements and its formally defined `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`.
    *   Example: The Microkernel's ResourceLockManager_ASA (from `SILA_Microkernel_SKYAIFS_Integration_Specification_V0.2.md`), when receiving a lock request, must verify that the `target_resource_identifier_cap` actually refers to a lockable resource type and that the requesting ASA has the authority to request a lock on it.
*   **Policy IS-IPC-003 (DoS Resistance for Endpoints - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   SILA IPC Endpoints exposed for critical inter-component integration (e.g., Microkernel services, SKYAIFS Supervisor) must have associated `SILA_EndpointPolicy_Record`s (enforced by the Microkernel or SILA runtime) that specify rate limiting, queue depth limits, and potentially differentiated service policies based on the validated PQC identity of the calling ASA, to prevent Denial of Service attacks.

## 3. SILA Containerization Security Policies

These policies are refined based on the mechanisms and objects detailed in `Documentation/Containerization/SILA_Containerization_Concept_V0.2.md`.

*   **Policy CS-ISO-001 (Default Deny Inter-Container Access - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   All inter-container SILA IPC, memory access, and capability sharing is denied by default by the Microkernel.
    *   Channels are only established by the "System_ContainerInterlink_ASA" based on explicit, PQC-signed policies found in the `allowed_inter_container_ipc_initiation_policy_array` section of a container's `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record`, and after performing authorization checks with both source and target containers if necessary.
*   **Policy CS-NS-001 (Namespace Integrity & Verification - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   The SILA logic within the Microkernel and its helper ASAs (e.g., `System_NetworkNamespaceSupervisor_ASA` for network namespaces; SKYAIFS ASAs for mount namespaces) responsible for emulating and enforcing namespace boundaries for SILA containers **must** be a primary target for formal verification. This is to prevent information leakage, unauthorized resource visibility, or cross-container interference via namespace manipulation.
*   **Policy CS-RES-001 (Strict Resource Quota Enforcement by Microkernel - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   Microkernel SILA operations for resource allocation (e.g., `SILA_Microkernel_AllocateMemoryRegion_Operation`, TCB creation and scheduling parameter assignment) **must** strictly enforce the quotas defined in the container's `SILA_ContainerResourcePolicy_Bundle_Record_Type` capability.
    *   Any attempt by a SILA process within a container to exceed its allocated quota must result in a clear, specific `SILA_ResourceExhausted_Error_Record` being returned to that process, without adversely affecting other containers or the host Microkernel/OS services.
*   **Policy CS-IMG-001 (Container Image Authenticity & Integrity Chain - V0.1.iter1 Update):**
    *   The AI Pipeline must PQC-sign (min 4096-bit equivalent, e.g., MLDSA_5) all `SILA_ContainerImage_Bundle_Record` structures.
    *   The Microkernel's `SILA_Microkernel_InstantiateContainer_FromDescriptor_Operation` **must** first verify this overall bundle signature.
    *   Subsequently, before loading any individual SILA module from the bundle's `sila_module_payloads_map`, the Microkernel (or its delegate, the `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` during image preparation if the model is such) **must** verify the individual PQC signature of that SILA module (binary and its manifest) as per Policy IS-IPC-001. This creates a chain of trust.

## 4. Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers (Examples V0.1.iter1 Update)

Building on general targets, these specific examples are now tied to the V0.2 integration designs:

1.  **Microkernel ResourceLockManager_ASA Logic (from SKYAIFS Integration V0.2):**
    *   **Requirement FV-INT-001:** Prove that the SILA logic of the `ResourceLockManager_ASA` correctly implements mutual exclusion for `ExclusiveWrite_EnumVal` locks and allows concurrent `SharedRead_EnumVal` locks, without the possibility of deadlock or livelock being introduced by the manager's own logic. Furthermore, prove that locks are only granted to SILA ASAs possessing a valid capability to request a lock on the specific target resource, and that lock capabilities are correctly revoked/invalidated upon release.
2.  **Container Interlink ASA Channel Setup Protocol & Policy Enforcement (from Containerization Concept V0.2):**
    *   **Requirement FV-CON-001:** Prove that the SILA IPC protocol and internal SILA graph logic used by the `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA` to establish inter-container communication channels correctly and completely enforces the policies defined in both the source and target containers' `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record`s (specifically the `allowed_inter_container_ipc_initiation_policy_array`). This includes verifying that the Microkernel-created endpoint capabilities are correctly restricted to only allow communication between the authorized pair of ASAs/services and that channel security policies (e.g., mandatory PQC encryption) are applied.
3.  **Microkernel PID Namespace Filtering & Isolation Logic (from Containerization Concept V0.2):**
    *   **Requirement FV-CON-002:** For the PID namespace, prove that the Microkernel's SILA logic for filtering or virtualizing process/TCB visibility for containerized SILA processes correctly prevents any information (including existence or capabilities) about PIDs/TCBs outside the container's defined PID namespace from being exposed to SILA processes within it, unless an explicit "shared PID namespace" policy is active and verified.

## 5. PQC Application in Integrated Systems (Min 4096-bit Reaffirmed)
Reaffirmation from previous policies: All PQC operations (as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md` e.g., for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, FALCON, HQC, SLH-DSA, and PQC-secure hashes like SHA3-512) will use algorithms and parameter sets achieving at least NIST PQC Level V (minimum 4096-bit RSA equivalent symmetric security, e.g., Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5). This applies rigorously to:
*   Encryption and authentication of SILA IPC message payloads traversing less trusted boundaries.
*   PQC signing and verification of `SILA_ContainerImage_Bundle_Record`s and all constituent `SILA_Packaged_Module_Object_Type`s (binaries and manifests).
*   Protection of any persistent state related to container configuration, management, or security policies if stored by SKYAIFS (e.g., PQC-encrypted at rest).
*   All cryptographic operations supporting SILA's PQC-aware data types and PQC key management interactions (e.g., with `System_KeyVault_ASA`).

## 6. Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS (V0.1.iter1 Update)

*   **New Threat Vector (TV-INT-001): Compromise of a Core Integration/Mediation SILA ASA.**
    *   **Description:** If a highly privileged SILA ASA that mediates critical inter-component or inter-container interactions (e.g., the `Microkernel_ResourceLockManager_ASA`, `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA`, `System_NetworkNamespaceSupervisor_ASA`) is compromised. This could be due to a flaw in its own formally unverified SILA code, a subtle misconfiguration of its operational SILA policies, or a sophisticated attack against the SILA runtime affecting it.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to widespread denial of service (e.g., deadlocking resource access), bypass of fine-grained security policies it's meant to enforce (e.g., unauthorized inter-container channel setup, incorrect network routing leading to exposure), or information leakage between isolated components.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies from V0.2 Designs & This Policy Iteration:**
        *   These specific ASAs are identified as high-priority targets for formal verification of their SILA logic and associated `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s (as per Section 4).
        *   Strict application of the Principle of Least Privilege via SILA capabilities for these ASAs themselves (they only get capabilities essential for their function).
        *   Their operational parameters and rules must be defined by PQC-signed `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s, loaded from a trusted configuration source.
        *   Robust auditing of all their significant actions via `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record`-like structures, allowing for monitoring by security AI agents.
        *   Compartmentalization: If feasible, break down monolithic mediator ASAs into smaller, single-purpose, and more easily verifiable SILA ASAs.
*   **Existing threats** regarding the SILA language, ADK, individual AI Bots, PQC implementations, and SILA runtime vulnerabilities (from `Refined_SILA_Security_Policies_Verification_Reqts_V0.1.md`) remain relevant and are now considered in the context of these complex integrated services and container interactions. The increased interaction points between major components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline, Containers) potentially increase the attack surface if any single component's interface or mediating ASA is flawed.

## Iteration 1 Conclusion
This first iteration of the `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy` has begun to align security policies more closely with the specific mechanisms and SILA ASA interactions detailed in the V0.2 Stage 3 design documents for Microkernel-SKYAIFS integration, Pipeline-Microkernel integration, and SILA Containerization. Concrete examples of formal verification requirements for critical integration points and containerization logic have been identified. The threat model has been updated to consider vulnerabilities in new core mediating ASAs introduced in these integration designs. The baseline of PQC minimum 4096-bit equivalent security is consistently enforced.The file `Documentation/Security_Policies/SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1.iter1.md` has been successfully created with the specified content.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 1 for the SILA Integration & Container Security Policy. The next step is to report this completion.

# Skyscope OS Unified Architecture Document V0.2 (SILA Edition)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Evolution to a SILA-Centric OS
This Version 0.2 of the Skyscope OS Unified Architecture Document marks a significant evolution from V0.1. It reflects the project's adoption of **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)** as the primary programming language for all core OS components. This paradigm shift also fully incorporates the foundational Stage 0 technologies: the AI-orchestrated **SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem)** and the **Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression** mechanism.

### 1.2. Purpose of V0.2
This document synthesizes the initial SILA-based design specifications from the Microkernel Architect, Filesystem Engineer, and AI Pipeline Specialist, along with the foundational PQC & SILA Security Policy from the Security Analyst. It aims to provide a cohesive architectural blueprint for Skyscope OS development within this new SILA-centric framework, guiding Stage 2 detailed design and implementation efforts.

## 2. SILA-Centric Component Architecture

### 2.1. Microkernel (SILA Implementation)
*   **Summary:** The microkernel's core services (IPC, memory management, scheduling, capabilities) are now defined as SILA semantic graph operations and objects. SILA's native `CapabilityToken` type is central to all resource access. PQC-aware types are used for kernel data structures.
*   **SILA APIs:** Interactions with the microkernel occur via well-defined SILA graph operations, ensuring type safety, verifiability, and capability-checked invocations. For example, IPC involves passing SILA capability tokens for endpoints and SILA structures for messages.
*   **SILA Leverage:** SILA's design for formal verifiability, its inherent PQC-awareness in data types, and its agent-oriented structure are expected to significantly enhance the microkernel's security, robustness, and maintainability by AI agents.

### 2.2. SKYAIFS (SILA Implementation)
*   **Summary:** SKYAIFS will be implemented entirely in SILA. Its metadata (inodes, directories, dynamic block maps) are SILA graph structures using PQC-aware types (min. 4096-bit security, e.g., `SILA_Encrypted<ML-KEM_1024, SKYAIFS_Metadata_Block>`). Immutability and versioning are handled via SILA's immutable data constructs.
*   **AI Bot Orchestration:** SKYAIFS AI bots (for defragmentation, data relocation, etc.) are defined as SILA modules/agent constructs, using SILA's state machines and concurrent programming features. Their actions are governed by SILA policies.
*   **SILA APIs:** SKYAIFS exposes high-level SILA operations for file system interactions and uses SILA IPC to communicate with the microkernel (for storage capabilities) and the Deep Compression service.

### 2.3. AI Pipeline & Module Management (SILA Framework)
*   **Summary:** The AI pipeline manages the lifecycle of all SILA-based OS components and AI models. Module manifests are themselves SILA structures, detailing dependencies, versions, PQC signatures, and compression status.
*   **SILA Module Management:** AI-driven dependency management leverages SILA's rich metadata for precise resolution. All SILA binaries and their manifests are PQC-signed and stored in a secure repository.
*   **SILA APIs & Operations:** Core pipeline operations (build, test, deploy) are orchestrated using high-level SILA scripts or policies, managing interactions between various AI agents (developer agents, build agents).

## 3. Integration of Stage 0 Technologies

### 3.1. SKYAIFS Integration
*   SKYAIFS, as a core SILA-based component, natively implements the Stage 0 concepts of AI bot orchestration, dynamic block management, and universal PQC security (min. 4096-bit) for all its data and metadata, as detailed in its SILA Implementation Plan.
*   Its interaction with the microkernel for raw storage access is mediated by SILA capabilities.

### 3.2. Deep Compression Integration
*   The AI Pipeline & Module Management system is the primary client of the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression service. SILA modules are generally stored in the repository in a deeply compressed format.
*   Decompression is orchestrated by the AI Pipeline via SILA calls to the Deep Compression service during module deployment or on-demand loading.
*   SKYAIFS may also utilize the Deep Compression service via SILA calls to transparently compress/decompress user file data, as defined in its SILA plan.
*   The microkernel is aware of the Deep Compression mechanism for early boot scenarios (if core kernel SILA components are compressed) and for managing memory for decompression operations.

## 4. Incorporation of Security Policy

Key tenets from the `Initial_PQC_SILA_Security_Policy_V0.1` are integrated throughout this architecture:

*   **PQC Standard:** All cryptographic operations (KEMs, signatures, hashes) adhere to a **minimum 4096-bit equivalent security level** (NIST PQC Level V). This is enforced by SILA's type system where PQC-aware types are used (e.g., `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<ML-KEM_1024, Data>`).
*   **SILA Language Security:**
    *   Emphasis on verifying AI-generated SILA code (via ADK security tools and SILA Verifier).
    *   PQC signing and strict access control for SILA's rich metadata layer.
    *   Security of the SILA toolchain is paramount.
*   **SKYAIFS Security:** Policies for AI bot permissions (least privilege via SILA capabilities), auditable triggers for data relocation, and PQC protection of all metadata are implemented within its SILA design.
*   **Deep Compression Security:** Integrity of compressed data (PQC hashes), secure operation of compression/decompression AI bots (via SILA capabilities), and DoS prevention are key design considerations for the Deep Compression SILA service.
*   **Threat Model:** The architecture acknowledges and aims to mitigate threats specific to a SILA-based, AI-orchestrated OS, including compromised ADK/AI agents, SILA metadata tampering, and PQC implementation vulnerabilities.

## 5. Updated Design Tables
*Table 1 (Microkernel Design Choice Matrix)* and *Table 2 (Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithm Selection)* from V0.1 are still largely relevant. The key update is that the "Skyscope Hybrid Target" and all algorithm selections now implicitly assume **implementation and enforcement via SILA constructs and its type system**, with PQC security levels elevated to a minimum of 4096-bit equivalent. The SILA language itself is the "how" for many of the choices.

## 6. Agentic Workflows & Development Process
The development of Skyscope OS components will heavily rely on **agentic workflows**. Specialized AI agents, utilizing the **SILA Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, will be responsible for:
*   Translating high-level requirements into SILA semantic graphs.
*   Generating, optimizing, and verifying SILA code.
*   Performing automated testing and deployment via the AI Pipeline.
Human developers will primarily focus on defining requirements, policies, overseeing AI agents, and advancing the ADK and AI capabilities.

## 7. Identified Gaps or Further Questions (Post-SILA Integration V0.2)

*   **SILA ADK Formal Interface Specification:** While the concept of the ADK is central, a formal specification for its APIs, its own security architecture, and the verification mechanisms for AI agent interactions with it are needed for Stage 2.
*   **Performance of SILA & Deep Compression:** What are the anticipated performance implications (latency, throughput, CPU/memory overhead) of SILA execution (especially for the microkernel) and the Deep Compression mechanism during critical paths like boot time and on-demand module loading? Benchmarking and optimization strategies will be crucial.
*   **SILA Runtime & Microkernel Boundary:** Clearer definition of the SILA runtime environment, especially the parts that might reside within the microkernel itself versus user-space SILA interpreters or JIT compilers for less critical components.
*   **Inter-AI-Agent Communication Protocols in SILA:** Standardized SILA-based protocols for robust and secure communication between different AI agents (e.g., SKYAIFS bots, AI Pipeline agents, security monitoring agents).
*   **Formal Verification Scope & Effort:** Defining the precise scope and estimating the effort for formally verifying key SILA components (microkernel, critical SKYAIFS logic, SILA toolchain) is a major task for Stage 2.

This V0.2 (SILA Edition) document lays a more concrete foundation for Skyscope OS. Addressing these identified gaps will be a priority in the next stage of development.All five requested SILA-based architectural documents for the revised Stage 1 have been successfully created:

1.  `Microkernel_SILA_Design_Specification_V0.1.md`
2.  `SKYAIFS_SILA_Implementation_Plan_V0.1.md`

4.  `Initial_PQC_SILA_Security_Policy_V0.1.md`
5.  `Skyscope_OS_Unified_Architecture_Document_V0.2_SILA_Edition.md`

The final document synthesizes the information from the preceding four, reflecting the shift to a SILA-centric OS architecture.

The subtask was to simulate the creation of these key documents. This has been completed.

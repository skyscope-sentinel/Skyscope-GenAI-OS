# Skyscope OS Integrated Core Component Design V0.1 (SILA Edition)

## 1. Executive Summary
This document synthesizes the detailed SILA-based designs for Skyscope OS's core components from Stage 2. It integrates the `SILA Microkernel Internals Design V0.1`, `SKYAIFS Detailed SILA Logic V0.1`, `SILA AI Pipeline & ADK Tooling Concepts V0.1`, and the `Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1`. The outcome is a more granular, holistic view of how the Microkernel, SKYAIFS, and AI Pipeline/ADK are designed to be implemented in **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)**, how they interact, and how security and verifiability are woven into their fabric. This V0.1 "Integrated Core Component Design" builds upon the V0.2 "Unified Architecture Document (SILA Edition)" from Stage 1, providing the next level of design specificity.

Key achievements include:
*   **Microkernel:** Detailed SILA data structures for TCBs, CSpaces, Endpoints, and Address Space Descriptors. Conceptual SILA semantic graph logic for critical operations like context switching, IPC, capability management, and fault handling. Refined SILA interfaces for SKYAIFS and Deep Compression.
*   **SKYAIFS:** Detailed SILA logic for AI Bot operations (e.g., Relocation Bot state machines and graph logic), metadata management (e.g., CreateFile in SILA), I/O paths (Read operation in SILA), and specific PQC operation invocations within SILA workflows.
*   **AI Pipeline & ADK:** Conceptual architecture of the SILA ADK (Graph APIs, Compiler/Verifier Interfaces, Debugger concepts), detailed SILA compiler/verifier workflow within the AI pipeline, SILA module packaging structure, and toolchain version management.
*   **Security:** Component-specific SILA security policies, identification of formal verification targets for critical SILA modules, refinement of the SILA-centric OS threat model, and elaboration on PQC key lifecycle management (min 4096-bit security).

## 2. Detailed Inter-Component SILA Interactions (Examples)

### 2.1. SKYAIFS Read Path Full Cycle
This illustrates interactions involving an application, SKYAIFS, Deep Compression (optional), and the Microkernel, all via SILA operations.

1.  **Application Request (SILA Call):**
    `app_agent_tcb_cap.SILA_Call(skyaifs_service_ep_cap, SILA_SKYAIFS_ReadFile_Request { file_target_cap, offset, length, app_buffer_cap })`
2.  **SKYAIFS Internal SILA Logic (Simplified):**
    *   Receives request via its main endpoint capability (`skyaifs_service_ep_cap`).
    *   Validates `file_target_cap` (capability to an `SKYAIFS_File_Descriptor` SILA structure).
    *   Accesses the file descriptor's block map (a SILA graph structure) to get a list of `SILA_LogicalBlock_Info_Struct`.
    *   **For each logical block needed:**
        *   Retrieves `block_info.is_compressed_flag`, `block_info.storage_location_cap` (points to physical storage or compressed object), `block_info.physical_block_id`, `block_info.block_pqc_key_ref_cap`.
        *   **If `is_compressed_flag` is TRUE:**
            *   `compressed_data_cap = Microkernel.SILA_Call(ReadBlock_Operation, block_info.storage_location_cap, block_info.physical_block_id)` (reads the compressed block).
            *   `decompressed_data_cap = DeepCompressionService.SILA_Call(DecompressBlock_Operation, compressed_data_cap, relevant_decompression_policy_sila_struct)`.
            *   `source_for_app_copy = decompressed_data_cap`.
        *   **Else (not compressed):**
            *   `raw_block_data_cap = Microkernel.SILA_Call(ReadBlock_Operation, block_info.storage_location_cap, block_info.physical_block_id)`.
            *   `source_for_app_copy = raw_block_data_cap`.
        *   **PQC Decryption (if applicable, conceptual):**
            *   `payload_for_app = CryptoService.SILA_Call(PQC_Decrypt_Operation<MLKEM_1024>, source_for_app_copy, block_info.block_pqc_key_ref_cap)`.
        *   `Microkernel.SILA_Call(CopyToUser_Operation, app_buffer_cap, payload_for_app, offset_in_app_buffer, length_from_this_block)`.
3.  **SKYAIFS Response (SILA Reply):**
    `current_tcb_cap.SILA_Reply(reply_to_app_agent_cap, SILA_SKYAIFS_ReadFile_Response { bytes_read, status_enum })`.

### 2.2. SILA Module Loading & Execution
This involves the Module Manager (part of AI Pipeline logic), AI Pipeline services, Deep Compression, and the Microkernel.

1.  **Request to Load Module (SILA Call):**
    `requesting_agent_tcb_cap.SILA_Call(module_manager_ep_cap, SILA_ModuleManager_LoadModule_Request { module_name_str, module_version_semver })`.
2.  **Module Manager SILA Logic:**
    *   Calls AI Pipeline Service to retrieve package: `package_cap = AIPipelineService.SILA_Call(RetrieveModulePackage_Operation, module_name_str, module_version_semver)`.
    *   AI Pipeline Service fetches `SILA_Packaged_Module_Record` from repository.
3.  **Decompression (Module Manager orchestrates via SILA Call):**
    *   Inspects `package_cap.compression_info`. If compressed:
        *   `decompressed_binary_cap = DeepCompressionService.SILA_Call(Decompress_Operation, package_cap.binary_payload)`.
    *   Else, `decompressed_binary_cap` is `package_cap.binary_payload`.
4.  **Verification (Module Manager orchestrates via SILA Call):**
    *   `verification_ok = OSLoaderService.SILA_Call(VerifyModuleSignatures_Operation, decompressed_binary_cap, package_cap.manifest_sila_struct)`.
5.  **Microkernel Loads SILA Module (SILA Call):**
    *   If verification OK: `process_id_cap = Microkernel.SILA_Call(LoadVerifiedSILAModule_Operation, decompressed_binary_cap, package_cap.manifest_sila_struct)`.
    *   This Microkernel operation involves creating TCBs, address spaces, and granting initial capabilities based on the SILA manifest.
6.  **Module Manager Response (SILA Reply):**
    `current_tcb_cap.SILA_Reply(reply_to_requesting_agent_cap, SILA_ModuleManager_LoadModule_Response { process_id_cap, status_enum })`.

## 3. Integration of Refined Security Policies
The `Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1` are integrated as follows:

*   **Microkernel:** SILA data structures for TCBs and CSpaces now explicitly include fields for PQC-protected registers or capability slots. The conceptual SILA graph logic for capability manipulation and IPC directly reflects policies for preventing unauthorized access or escalation. Fault handling SILA state machines are designed for reliable delivery to authorized handlers.
*   **SKYAIFS:** The detailed SILA logic for AI bots (e.g., Relocation Bot) incorporates authorization checks (e.g., requiring multi-factor triggers via SILA events) before critical actions. Metadata operations in SILA are designed for immutability and include PQC signing steps. SILA capabilities strictly limit bot access to keys and data.
*   **AI Pipeline & ADK:** The ADK conceptual APIs include interfaces to the SILA Verifier, enforcing policy checks during development. The pipeline workflow mandates PQC signing of SILA binaries and manifests. Secure invocation of SILA toolchain components is assumed via capability-protected SILA service calls.
*   **PQC Standard (Min 4096-bit):** All SILA data types and operations specifying PQC algorithms (e.g., `SILA_PQC_Encrypt<MLKEM_1024>`) inherently reference the approved high-security parameter sets.

## 4. Formal Verification Targets (Consolidated List - Examples)
Based on the Security Analyst's refined requirements, key targets for formal verification using the SILA Verifier include:

*   **Microkernel:**
    *   SILA IPC Subsystem (confidentiality, integrity, no deadlock).
    *   SILA Capability Management (rights enforcement, revocation correctness).
    *   SILA TCB Scheduler (priority enforcement, no starvation).
    *   SILA TCB State Transition Logic.
*   **SKYAIFS:**
    *   SILA Metadata Update Atomicity/Consistency.
    *   SILA AI Bot Authorization Logic for critical operations.
    *   SILA Logic for PQC Per-File Key Derivation and Usage.
*   **AI Pipeline & ADK:**
    *   SILA ADK Core Graph Validation APIs (correct identification of insecure patterns).
    *   SILA Verifier Tool itself (core logic).
    *   SILA Compiler (ensuring it doesn't introduce vulnerabilities).

## 5. SILA ADK & Toolchain Conceptual Dependencies
The detailed component designs highlight the following needs from the SILA ADK and toolchain:

*   **ADK:** Robust SILA APIs for graph construction, modification, and querying; seamless interfaces to compiler, verifier, and agent-oriented debugger; sophisticated simulation environment.
*   **SILA Compiler:** Efficient translation of complex SILA semantic graphs to secure, performant binary code; generation of rich, PQC-signed metadata.
*   **SILA Verifier:** Ability to check SILA graphs/binaries against formal specifications and complex security policies (also expressed in a SILA-compatible format). Must be scalable.
*   **SILA Debugger:** Advanced capabilities for AI agents to understand and debug SILA graph execution at a semantic level.

## 6. Consolidated Gaps & Future Work for Stage 3 (Integration & Containerization - SILA)

*   **Detailed SILA Specifications for Device Drivers:** While SKYAIFS interacts with raw storage via microkernel SILA calls, the internal SILA design of various device drivers (network, GPU, input) is needed.
*   **SILA-based Networking Stack Design:** A complete networking stack designed and implemented in SILA, including PQC-secured protocols.
*   **SILA Runtime Environment Details:** Further specification of the SILA runtime, including its own security, resource management, and interaction with the microkernel (especially if parts of the runtime are in user space for non-critical SILA modules).
*   **Performance Benchmarks & Optimization for SILA Operations:** Critical SILA operations within the microkernel, SKYAIFS I/O paths, and Deep Compression need performance targets and benchmarking to ensure system viability.
*   **SILA Interface for Containerization Primitives:** How will OS-level containerization be supported? Define SILA interfaces for creating, managing, and isolating SILA-based containers/processes.
*   **Formal Specification Language for SILA Verification:** Define the language/format used to write the formal specifications and security policies that the SILA Verifier will use as input.
*   **AI Agent Training for SILA Development:** Strategies and environments for training the AI agents that will use the SILA ADK to develop and maintain Skyscope OS.

This integrated design document provides a solid foundation for commencing Stage 3, where the focus will shift towards integrating these core SILA components and building out further OS capabilities.All five detailed SILA-based architectural documents for Stage 2 have now been successfully created:

1.  `SILA_Microkernel_Internals_Design_V0.1.md`
2.  `SKYAIFS_Detailed_SILA_Logic_V0.1.md`
3.  `SILA_AI_Pipeline_ADK_Tooling_Concepts_V0.1.md`
4.  `Refined_SILA_Security_Policies_Verification_Reqts_V0.1.md`

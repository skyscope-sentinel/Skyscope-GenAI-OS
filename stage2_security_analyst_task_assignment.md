**Subject: Stage 2 Task - Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1**

**To: Security Analyst**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 2 - Core Component Development (in SILA)**
**Iteration: 1**

**Directive:**

Building upon the `Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy V0.1` from Stage 1, and in light of the emerging detailed SILA-based designs for the Microkernel, SKYAIFS, and AI Pipeline/ADK, your task is to produce the **Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1**. This document will provide more specific security guidance and establish clear targets for formal verification.

**Key Requirements for the Refined Policies and Verification Requirements:**

1.  **Component-Specific SILA Security Policies:**
    *   Develop specific security policies for critical operations and data structures within the SILA-based designs of:
        *   **Microkernel:** e.g., policies governing capability manipulation, IPC message validation, TCB state transitions, secure bootstrapping of SILA code.
        *   **SKYAIFS:** e.g., policies for AI bot authorization and behavior (data relocation triggers, access to encryption keys), integrity of distributed metadata operations, secure interaction with the Deep Compression service.
        *   **AI Pipeline & ADK:** e.g., policies for secure SILA code generation by AI agents via the ADK, integrity and authenticity of SILA toolchain components (compiler, verifier), secure handling of PQC keys during module signing.

2.  **Formal Verification Requirements for Critical SILA Modules:**
    *   Identify critical SILA modules or specific functionalities within the Microkernel, SKYAIFS, and AI Pipeline that require formal verification of their correctness and security properties.
    *   For each identified module/functionality, define high-level formal verification requirements. Examples:
        *   *"The SILA IPC module must formally guarantee that messages cannot be delivered to unauthorized endpoint capabilities."*
        *   *"The SILA capability minting operation must formally ensure that derived capabilities do not possess rights exceeding the original."*
        *   *"The SKYAIFS AI bot responsible for data relocation under duress must formally verify the authenticity of the trigger signal before initiating data movement."*
    *   These requirements will guide the efforts of AI agents using the SILA Verifier tool.

3.  **Threat Model Refinement & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Refine the initial OS threat model (from Stage 1) based on the detailed SILA component designs. Identify any new potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors.
    *   Propose specific mitigation strategies for the identified threats, detailing how these strategies can be implemented or enforced through SILA language features, architectural design, or operational policies within the AI-driven OS.

4.  **PQC Key Lifecycle Management in SILA Systems:**
    *   Elaborate on PQC key lifecycle management (generation, distribution, storage, rotation, revocation) specifically for a SILA-based system.
    *   Address challenges such as:
        *   Securely providing PQC keys to SILA-based AI bots and system services.
        *   Managing ephemeral keys used in SILA communication protocols.
        *   Ensuring the integrity of SILA structures that reference or contain PQC key material or capabilities.
    *   All PQC operations must continue to adhere to the minimum 4096-bit equivalent security level.

**Output Format:**

*   An updated and refined security policy document (Markdown or similar).
*   This document should provide actionable security guidance for AI agents developing SILA code and define clear objectives for formal verification efforts.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

Your work in this stage is crucial for ensuring that the detailed SILA component designs are built upon a robust and verifiable security foundation.

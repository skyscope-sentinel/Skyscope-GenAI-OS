# SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem) Conceptual Framework V0.1

## 1. Core Principles
SKYAIFS is a novel filesystem designed from the ground up for Skyscope OS. Its core principles are:
*   **AI-Orchestrated:** Central AI agents and distributed bots manage all aspects of filesystem operation.
*   **Dynamic & Adaptive:** Filesystem structure and behavior adapt in real-time to usage patterns, threats, and hardware conditions.
*   **Resilient & Self-Healing:** Proactive detection and automated recovery from data corruption or unauthorized access.
*   **PQC-Secured:** All data and metadata are protected by Post-Quantum Cryptography using minimum 4096-bit encryption standards or better.
*   **Unmodifiable Core:** Core filesystem metadata structures, once written and verified, are immutable, with updates creating new, versioned structures.

## 2. Dynamic Block/Sector Management
*   **Variable-Sized Logical Blocks:** SKYAIFS will utilize variable-sized logical blocks, rather than fixed-size physical sectors directly. AI will determine optimal block sizes for different file types or access patterns to improve storage efficiency and I/O performance.
*   **AI-Managed Allocation:** AI bots will manage the allocation of these logical blocks to physical storage, abstracting the underlying physical layout.
*   **Metadata for Dynamic Structures:** Rich metadata, itself PQC-protected, will describe these dynamic structures.

## 3. AI Bot Orchestration
Specialized AI bots, orchestrated by a central SKYAIFS AI supervisor, perform key functions:
*   **Defragmentation Bots:** Continuously monitor and reorganize logical blocks to minimize fragmentation and optimize data layout for performance, without downtime.
*   **Data Relocation Bots:**
    *   **On Attack Detection:** If an attack (e.g., unauthorized access attempt, ransomware behavior) is detected (by OS security services or filesystem-level anomaly detection), these bots can automatically and rapidly relocate sensitive data to secure, isolated storage areas or change its encryption keys.
    *   **On Corruption Detection:** If data corruption is detected (via checksums, Merkle tree failures), bots attempt to recover from redundant copies or trigger data regeneration if possible. If unrecoverable, affected data is isolated.
*   **Predictive Placement Bots:** Analyze data access patterns to predictively place frequently accessed data or related data clusters onto faster storage tiers or in physically contiguous locations.
*   **Integrity Verification Bots:** Continuously verify filesystem integrity using PQC-signed Merkle trees and other checksums.

## 4. PQC Integration
*   **Universal PQC:** All file content and metadata will be encrypted using PQC algorithms (e.g., ML-KEM variant with >=4096-bit equivalent security).
*   **Unique Keys:** Each file or logical block will have a unique encryption key, derived from a master key system managed by the OS and protected by the user's PQC password.
*   **Metadata Signing:** All filesystem metadata (inode-equivalents, directory structures, block allocation tables, Merkle tree nodes) will be digitally signed using PQC algorithms (e.g., ML-DSA variant).
*   **PQC-Secure Hashes:** Merkle trees for integrity verification will use PQC-secure hash functions.

## 5. Interface with Microkernel
*   **Built in SILA:** SKYAIFS will be implemented in the new SILA language.
*   **Microkernel Services:** It will rely on the Skyscope microkernel for:
    *   Secure IPC to communicate with other OS components.
    *   Memory management services for its own operation and for managing data buffers.
    *   Capability system for accessing storage devices and other resources.
*   **Storage Device Abstraction:** The microkernel will provide a low-level, capability-protected interface to raw storage devices. SKYAIFS will manage all higher-level storage abstractions.
*   **Fault Reporting:** SKYAIFS will report critical errors or security events to the microkernel and OS security services.

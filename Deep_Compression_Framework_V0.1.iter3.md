# Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression Conceptual Framework - V0.1 - Iteration 3

**Based on:** `Deep_Compression_Framework_V0.1.iter2.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Novel algorithm registration/integration in SILA, performance profiling & dynamic adaptation via SILA, identifying formal verification targets, enhanced security of compressed data (PQC).

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from Iteration 2. All concepts are grounded in SILA V0.2, leveraging Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents (ASAs), PQC-aware types (min 4096-bit security), verifiable contracts, and SILA IPC.

## 2. AI Bot Roles (as SILA ASAs)

### 2.1. Analysis & Strategy Bot ASA (ASB_Analyzer)
Logic refined for dynamic algorithm discovery and integration.

#### 2.1.1. Novel Algorithm Integration & Registration (SILA)
*   **SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA:** A dedicated, trusted SILA ASA responsible for maintaining a PQC-signed registry of available compression algorithms/modules. AI algorithm specialists (or their representative AI agents) interact with this ASA to register new compression techniques.
*   **`SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record` (SILA Record for Registration):**
    `{
      algorithm_id: SILA_UniqueID_String, // e.g., "PQC_LZVariant_Streaming_v1.2"
      algorithm_name_human_readable_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_String_Record>,
      provider_agent_identity_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_Identity_Type>, // Capability to the identity of the agent/organization registering the algorithm
      version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String,
      algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_ASA_Module_Definition_Type>, // Capability to the deployable SILA ASA module that implements the worker logic for this algorithm
      interface_specification_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_Interface_Specification_Record>, // Defines the SILA messages and EPs the worker ASA expects
      supported_data_types_or_profiles_list: SILA_Array<SILA_DataProfileHint_Enum>, // Hints for what data it's good for
      expected_performance_characteristics_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_AlgorithmPerformanceProfile_Record>, // Link to a profile (see 6.1)
      pqc_friendliness_assessment_record_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQCFriendliness_Factors_Record>, // Details on block independence, streamability, etc.
      verification_and_audit_status_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_FormalVerification_Summary_Record>, // Link to its formal verification status/proofs
      registration_pqc_signature: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5> // Signature by the registering authority/agent
    }`
*   **ASB_Analyzer Algorithm Discovery Workflow (SILA Logic):**
    1.  `ASB_Analyzer` receives `data_to_analyze_cap` and `analysis_policy_cap`.
    2.  It profiles the data (as per Iteration 2).
    3.  It constructs a `SILA_AlgorithmQuery_Record` based on data profile, policy hints (e.g., speed vs. ratio, required PQC friendliness score), and resource constraints.
    4.  It sends this query via SILA IPC to `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA_EP_Cap`.
    5.  The `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA` filters its list of `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record` capabilities based on the query and returns a `SILA_Array<SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record>>` of suitable, verified algorithms.
    6.  `ASB_Analyzer` then uses its AI models (as in Iteration 2) to select the optimal algorithm(s) from this filtered list to populate the `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record`. The plan will now include the `algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap` for the chosen algorithm.

### 2.2. Parallel Processing Bot ASA Coordinator (ASB_Coordinator)
Retained from Iteration 2. Manages chunking and distribution of work to `ASB_Worker` ASAs.

### 2.3. Worker Compression/Decompression Bot ASA (ASB_Worker)
*   **Dynamic Algorithm Execution:** An `ASB_Worker` is now a more generic SILA ASA execution shell.
*   When `ASB_Coordinator` sends a `SILA_CompressionWorkItem_Record`, this record now includes the `algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap` (obtained from the `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record` which got it from the `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record`).
*   The `ASB_Worker` uses this capability to dynamically load and execute (or delegate to) the specific compression algorithm's SILA module for the given data chunk. This might involve the `ASB_Worker` requesting the Microkernel (via SILA IPC) to instantiate a sandboxed instance of the `algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap` if SILA supports such dynamic loading for sub-tasks, or the `ASB_Worker` itself acts as a host for executing the logic defined in the module capability.

### 2.4. Integrity Verification Bot ASA (ASB_Integrity)
Retained from Iteration 2. Its role in verifying PQC hashes is critical.

### 2.5. Resource Management Bot ASA (ASB_ResourceManager)
Retained from Iteration 2. Enhanced by performance profiling data.

## 3. Primary SILA IPC Service Interface
Retained from Iteration 2.

## 4. Reliability and Error Handling in SILA
Retained from Iteration 2, including SILA event structures for integrity failures and ADK-generated retry patterns for worker failures.

## 5. Refined SILA Structures for Policies
Retained from Iteration 2. `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` guides `ASB_Analyzer`.

## 6. Performance Profiling & Dynamic Adaptation (SILA)

*   **Metric Collection by ASB_Workers:** Each `ASB_Worker`, after processing a chunk using a specific `algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap`, generates a `SILA_CompressionOp_Performance_Record`:
    `SILA_CompressionOp_Performance_Record {
      execution_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      algorithm_descriptor_used_cap_ref: SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record>, // Reference to the algorithm descriptor
      input_chunk_size_bytes_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer,
      output_chunk_size_bytes_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer,
      cpu_micro_ops_abstract_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer, // Abstract CPU work metric from SILA runtime/Microkernel
      peak_memory_usage_bytes_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer,
      processing_duration_ms_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer,
      operation_success_bool: SILA_Secure_Boolean,
      timestamp: SILA_Timestamp_Record
    }`
*   **Reporting to Performance Model ASA:** `ASB_Coordinator` (or workers directly if policy allows) forwards these `SILA_CompressionOp_Performance_Record` capabilities via SILA IPC to a central "SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA".
*   **`SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` Logic:**
    *   This specialized SILA ASA aggregates performance data. It builds statistical models or trains/updates internal AI models (itself a PQC-signed SILA module invoked via `SILA_Call_AI_Model_Operation`) for each registered compression algorithm. These models correlate `data_profile_report_cap` characteristics, `compression_policy_hints_cap`, and observed performance metrics.
    *   Periodically, or upon significant model updates, it proposes updates to the `expected_performance_characteristics_cap` within the `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record` stored by the `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA`. This update is a PQC-signed transaction requiring authorization from the Registry ASA.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation by ASB_Analyzer:** The `ASB_Analyzer` uses these continuously updated (and versioned) `SILA_AlgorithmPerformanceProfile_Record` capabilities from the Registry when making its decisions. This creates a feedback loop, allowing the system to learn and adapt its compression strategies over time based on real-world performance.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation by ASB_ResourceManager:** `ASB_ResourceManager` can also query the `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` (e.g., "What's the predicted resource use for compressing 10 chunks of Type X using Algorithm Y?"). This allows it to proactively adjust concurrent `ASB_Worker` limits or re-prioritize jobs in the `ASB_Coordinator`'s queue by sending SILA policy update messages.

## 7. Data Structures & Algorithms / Self-Describing Format
Retained from Iteration 2. The `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` (PQC-signed by `ASB_Coordinator`) is critical. PQC-friendliness of entropy coders remains an active research item for specialist AI agents.

### 7.1. Enhanced Security of Compressed Data (PQC Aspects)
*   **Metadata Header Integrity & Authenticity:** The `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record`'s PQC signature (e.g., MLDSA_5) must be verified by `ASB_Integrity` (or the initial processing stages of decompression) *before* any decompression attempt using keys/authorities defined in a system-wide PQC policy. A maliciously crafted header could otherwise attempt to cause issues (e.g., specify a vulnerable algorithm, incorrect chunk sizes leading to buffer overflows if not handled carefully by workers). The SILA type system should ensure the signature refers to a trusted "Header Signing Policy" capability accessible by the signing ASA.
*   **Compressed Payload Integrity (Overall & Per Chunk):**
    *   The `compressed_data_pqc_hash` within the header provides an overall integrity check for the entire compressed payload. This must be verified after full decompression by `ASB_Integrity`.
    *   If data is chunked (as per `chunk_descriptors_array_opt` in the header), each `SILA_CompressedChunk_Descriptor_Record` must also contain a `chunk_pqc_hash: SILA_PQC_Hash_Record<SHA3_256_SILA_Enum>`.
    *   `ASB_Worker` ASAs responsible for decompressing a chunk must first verify this chunk-specific hash against the received compressed chunk data. This detects corruption early.
*   **Authenticated Encryption (AEAD) Layer (Optional, Policy-Driven):**
    *   For highly sensitive data (indicated by `data_sensitivity_label_opt` in the `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record`), the entire compressed payload (or, more granularly, individual chunks) could be further PQC-encrypted using an AEAD scheme (e.g., AES-256-GCM where the symmetric key is encapsulated/wrapped using MLKEM_1024, and the GCM tag provides authentication).
    *   The SILA PQC primitive operations (`SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`) would need to provide interfaces for such AEAD modes.
    *   The `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` would then securely include references to the necessary PQC-wrapped keys (as SILA capabilities) and AEAD authentication tags for each encrypted segment. The `ASB_Worker` ASAs would require corresponding decryption key capabilities to process these segments.

## 8. Formal Verification Targets for Deep Compression (Initial Identification)

1.  **ASB_Integrity Hash Verification Logic (SILA):** The core SILA graph logic of the `ASB_Integrity` ASA responsible for:
    a. Securely retrieving expected PQC hash values from a trusted `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record`.
    b. Correctly invoking SILA PQC hash primitives on data buffers (original, compressed, decompressed, chunks).
    c. Performing the comparison and signaling success/failure without side channels.
    This logic must be formally verified to ensure it reliably detects tampering or corruption and cannot be bypassed.
2.  **ASB_Coordinator Data Capability Management (SILA):** The SILA logic within `ASB_Coordinator` that manages SILA capabilities to data chunks (`SILA_MemoryRegion_Chunk_CapToken`) – including their creation for sub-regions, distribution to `ASB_Worker` ASAs, and ensuring they are properly revoked or their access rights are correctly constrained after use – must be formally verified. This is to prevent capability leakage, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or unauthorized data access between different compression jobs or workers.
3.  **ASB_Analyzer Policy Enforcement for Algorithm Selection (SILA):** If the `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` includes security-critical constraints (e.g., "Algorithm X is forbidden for data labeled 'Kernel_Module_SILA_Type'" or "Only algorithms with 'PQC_Friendliness_Score > 0.9' can be used for PQC-signed data"), the SILA logic in `ASB_Analyzer` that queries the `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA` and then applies these policy constraints during the selection of algorithms for the `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record` must be formally verified to ensure these critical policy rules are correctly and unfailingly enforced.

## Iteration 3 Conclusion
This iteration has substantially advanced the Deep Compression framework by:
1.  Defining a SILA-based mechanism for dynamic registration and discovery of novel AI-driven compression algorithms via a `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA` and detailed `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record`s.
2.  Outlining a system for ongoing performance profiling of these algorithms and dynamic adaptation of compression strategies by `ASB_Analyzer` and `ASB_ResourceManager`, leveraging a `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA`.
3.  Identifying three critical Deep Compression SILA modules/logic paths (integrity verification, data capability management by coordinator, and security policy enforcement in algorithm selection) as prime candidates for formal verification.
4.  Further enhancing the PQC-related security considerations for the compressed data stream, including metadata header security and per-chunk integrity checks.
These developments pave the way for a highly adaptive, secure, and extensible Deep Compression service built on SILA.The file `Deep_Compression_Framework_V0.1.iter3.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 3 for the Deep Compression Conceptual Framework. The next step is to report this completion.

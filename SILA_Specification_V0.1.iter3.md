# SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents) Specification - V0.1 - Iteration 3

**Based on:** `SILA_Specification_V0.1.iter2.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Error handling/fault tolerance, HAL interaction, SILA language versioning, refined ADK APIs for complex patterns.

## 1. Name & Core Philosophy
Retained from Iteration 2. The core philosophy of AI-centric design, verifiability, security, efficiency, and abstraction remains paramount.

## 3. Abstract Syntax & Structure
Retained from Iteration 2. Semantic Graphs, typed edges (e.g., `ControlFlow_Conditional`, `DataFlow_Typed`, `CapabilityFlow_Restricted`, `PolicyBinding_Edge`), and attributed nodes (e.g., `Node_PQC_Context_Attribute`, `Node_Verification_Annotation`) are the foundational elements.

## 4. Key Semantic Concepts

### 4.1. Data Types
Retained from Iteration 2. Key aspects include:
*   Parameterized `SILA_CapToken<Referenced_SILA_Type_Descriptor_Cap>`.
*   ADK-driven definition of PQC-Aware Structures (e.g., `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Define_PQC_Struct_Type`) with explicit algorithm choices (min 4096-bit PQC security like MLKEM_1024) and key management policies.

### 4.2. Control Flow (Conceptual)
Retained from Iteration 2, including Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents (ASA) as the primary concurrency model, Guarded Execution for shared resource access, and refined `SILA_PolicyRule_Struct` within `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`.

### 4.2.1. Error Handling & Fault Tolerance in SILA
*   **Error Representation:**
    *   Errors are represented as specific, typed `SILA_Error_Record` structures. These are SILA Records themselves, allowing for rich, structured error information.
    *   Examples: `SILA_IPC_Timeout_Error_Record`, `SILA_Capability_InvalidRights_Error_Record`, `SILA_PQC_Decryption_Failure_Error_Record`, `SILA_PolicyViolation_Error_Record`.
    *   Each error record includes fields like `error_id: SILA_UniqueID`, `source_node_ref: SILA_NodeID`, `timestamp: SILA_Timestamp`, and error-type-specific details.
*   **Error Propagation & Handling:**
    *   **Typed Results:** SILA operations (as defined by ADK-generated graph patterns or core language primitives) that can produce errors must return a `SILA_Result_Union<Success_SILA_Type_Cap, SILA_Error_Type_Cap>`. This forces AI agents using the ADK to explicitly consider and handle potential error cases when constructing SILA graphs.
    *   **Explicit Error Handling Graphs:** AI agents can define specific SILA subgraphs as error handlers for particular operations or ASA message processing loops. These handlers are invoked when an operation returns an error type.
    *   **ASA Unhandled Error Policy:** ASAs can be configured with a policy for unhandled errors during message processing, e.g., send error to a supervisor agent, enter a safe state, or terminate gracefully. This is part of the ASA's definition via the ADK.
*   **Verifiable Error Handlers:** Error handling SILA graph segments can be associated with their own `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`, specifying preconditions (e.g., type of error received) and postconditions (e.g., system state after handling). The SILA Verifier checks these.
*   **Fault Tolerance Patterns (Language/ADK Support):** The ADK will provide high-level APIs for AI agents to generate standard fault tolerance patterns as SILA graphs:
    *   **Retry Pattern:** `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Generate_Retry_SILA_Pattern(operation_to_retry_graph_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken, retry_policy_cap: SILA_CapToken_To_RetryPolicy_Record) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`. The `SILA_RetryPolicy_Record` would specify number of retries, backoff strategy (e.g., exponential, jitter), and conditions for aborting retries.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Generate_CircuitBreaker_SILA_Pattern(monitored_operation_graph_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken, circuit_breaker_policy_cap: SILA_CapToken_To_CBPolicy_Record) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`. The `SILA_CBPolicy_Record` includes failure thresholds, reset timeouts, and fallback operation references. The circuit breaker itself is a SILA state machine.
    *   **Redundancy/Voting (Conceptual):** For highly critical operations, the ADK might offer patterns to define N-version redundant execution of a SILA subgraph, with a PQC-signed voting mechanism (another SILA graph) to determine the final result. This requires careful management of input capabilities and state consistency.

### 4.3. Memory Management Model
Retained from Iteration 2. Relies on capability-based access to memory regions provided and managed by the SILA-based microkernel.

### 4.4. AI Integration Features
Retained from Iteration 2.

### 4.5. Formal Verifiability Enhancements
Retained from Iteration 2, including `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`, Information Flow Control policies, and support for verifying Temporal Logic properties. Error handling logic is now also a target for contract-based verification.

### 4.6. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Interaction (Conceptual)
SILA enables AI agents to write device drivers by interacting with hardware resources through capabilities provided by the SILA-based microkernel. This promotes security and abstraction.
*   **Device Capabilities:** The microkernel, upon detecting hardware, creates and grants a typed `SILA_Device_CapToken<Specific_Device_Type_Descriptor_Cap>` to a trusted SILA device driver ASA (loaded by the AI Pipeline). This capability is the root for all interactions with that specific device.
*   **Register Access (via Microkernel SILA Operations):**
    *   `SILA_Microkernel_ReadDeviceRegister_Op(device_access_cap: SILA_Device_CapToken, register_offset_or_id: SILA_Hardware_Register_Identifier, result_type_descriptor_cap: SILA_TypeDescriptor_CapToken) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_Any_Record, SILA_Error_Record>`
    *   `SILA_Microkernel_WriteDeviceRegister_Op(device_access_cap: SILA_Device_CapToken, register_offset_or_id: SILA_Hardware_Register_Identifier, value_to_write: SILA_Any_Record) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_Void, SILA_Error_Record>`
    *   `SILA_Hardware_Register_Identifier` could be a SILA Enum for known/named registers or a validated offset for dynamic access. The microkernel uses `device_access_cap` to ensure the driver is authorized for the specific device and register. The `result_type_descriptor_cap` ensures type-safe interpretation of register values.
*   **DMA Management (via Microkernel SILA Operations):**
    *   Driver ASA requests a DMA-able memory buffer: `SILA_Microkernel_AllocateDMABuffer_Op(owning_driver_asa_cap: SILA_CapToken, size_bytes: SILA_Int, dma_direction_enum: SILA_DMA_Direction_Enum, dma_constraints_policy_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken>) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken, SILA_Error_Record>`.
    *   The returned `SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken` grants access to a SILA structure that includes methods to get physical address for DMA controller, manage cache coherency (via microkernel ops), etc.
    *   Driver ASA programs device DMA controller using `SILA_Microkernel_WriteDeviceRegister_Op` with the physical address obtained from the `SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken`.
    *   The Microkernel, with IOMMU hardware, configures DMA isolation based on the granted `SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken`.
*   **Interrupt Handling (via Microkernel SILA IPC):**
    *   Driver ASA registers an interrupt handler SILA endpoint: `SILA_Microkernel_RegisterInterruptHandler_Op(device_access_cap: SILA_Device_CapToken, irq_descriptor: SILA_IRQ_Descriptor_Record, target_asa_handler_ep_cap: SILA_CapToken) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_Void, SILA_Error_Record>`.
    *   When a hardware interrupt occurs, the Microkernel's low-level SILA interrupt dispatcher identifies the source and sends a `SILA_Interrupt_Event_Record` message (containing IRQ info, timestamp, device cap) via SILA IPC to the registered `target_asa_handler_ep_cap`. The driver ASA processes this message in its event loop.

## 5. Non-Human Readability & AI Accessibility
Retained from Iteration 2.

### 5.1. Agent Development Kit (ADK) - Refined APIs for Complex Tasks
*   **Fault Tolerance Pattern Generation (as mentioned in 4.2.1):**
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Generate_FaultTolerant_SILA_Wrapper(target_operation_graph_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken, fault_tolerance_policy: SILA_FaultToleranceConfig_Record { type: SILA_FT_Enum {Retry, CircuitBreaker, RedundantExec}, params_cap: SILA_CapToken}) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`
*   **Version-Aware Module Generation & Migration Assistance:**
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Create_SILA_Module_Graph(module_name: SILA_String, target_sila_lang_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String, compatibility_policy_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken>) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Analyze_SILA_Module_For_Version_Compatibility(module_graph_handle_cap: SILA_GraphHandle_Cap, new_sila_lang_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String) -> SILA_CompatibilityReport_Record`
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Attempt_AutoMigration_SILA_Module(module_graph_handle_cap: SILA_GraphHandle_Cap, current_version: SILA_String, target_version: SILA_String, migration_rules_cap_list: SILA_Array<SILA_GraphTransformationRule_CapToken>) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap` (for automated refactoring where possible).
*   **Hardware Interaction Pattern Libraries (ADK):**
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Generate_DeviceDriver_Initialization_SILA_Pattern(device_type_descriptor_cap: SILA_CapToken, required_resources_list_cap: SILA_CapToken) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`. This provides a template SILA graph for typical driver initialization sequences (e.g., discover device, request resources, map registers, register interrupt handler).
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Generate_DMA_Transfer_SILA_Pattern(dma_buffer_object_cap: SILA_DMABuffer_Object_CapToken, device_register_access_policy_cap: SILA_CapToken, transfer_params_record: SILA_DMATransferConfig_Record) -> SILA_GraphHandle_Cap`.

## 6. Toolchain Concept (AI-Driven)
Retained from Iteration 2. The SILA Verifier must now also understand and check fault tolerance patterns and hardware interaction protocols against microkernel-defined constraints for specific device capabilities.

## 7. SILA Runtime Security Considerations
Retained from Iteration 2. Emphasis on runtime enforcement of capability checks for hardware access operations.

## 8. SILA Language Versioning & Evolution (Initial Thoughts)
*   **SILA Language Version Numbers:** SILA language itself will be versioned using Semantic Versioning (e.g., `SILA_Lang_V1.0.0`, `SILA_Lang_V1.1.0`). This version is distinct from individual SILA module versions.
*   **Module Manifest Specification:** Compiled SILA modules will include in their PQC-signed metadata a precise `target_sila_language_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String` field.
*   **SILA Runtime Compatibility & Enforcement:**
    *   The SILA Runtime Environment (particularly the part integrated with or reporting to the Microkernel) must identify the `target_sila_language_version` of any SILA module before execution.
    *   It must support a defined range of SILA language versions. For example, a SILA Runtime supporting SILA_Lang_V1.x must execute SILA_Lang_V1.0.0, V1.1.0, etc. modules.
    *   It must refuse to load or execute modules targeting an incompatible or significantly newer major version for which it doesn't have runtime support, reporting a `SILA_LanguageVersionMismatch_Error_Record`.
*   **ADK and Toolchain Versioning & Awareness:**
    *   The SILA ADK, Compiler, and Verifier will also be versioned.
    *   The ADK will allow AI agents to specify the `target_sila_language_version` when creating new SILA module graphs. The ADK will then only expose language constructs and patterns compatible with that target version.
    *   The Compiler will embed the correct language version into the compiled module's metadata.
*   **Feature Deprecation & Evolution Strategy:**
    *   New SILA language versions may introduce new features or deprecate older ones. Deprecation will follow a defined lifecycle (e.g., DeprecatedIn_V1.1, RemovedIn_V2.0).
    *   The SILA Runtime will maintain support for deprecated features for a specified number of backward-compatible versions.
    *   The ADK will:
        *   Warn AI agents when using deprecated constructs for a given target SILA version.
        *   Provide guidance and, where possible, automated refactoring tools (SILA-to-SILA graph transformations) to migrate SILA code from deprecated features to newer equivalents. These transformation rules could be formal SILA graph patterns themselves.
    *   The SILA Verifier can be configured to flag usage of deprecated features based on project policy.

## Iteration 3 Conclusion
This iteration significantly advanced SILA's practical applicability for OS development by defining robust error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms at the language/ADK level. It also conceptualized how SILA device drivers will interact with hardware through microkernel-provided capabilities and SILA operations, ensuring security and abstraction. Crucially, initial principles for SILA language versioning and evolution were established, providing a path for future language development while maintaining compatibility. ADK APIs were further refined to support these more complex OS development patterns.The file `SILA_Specification_V0.1.iter3.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 3 for the SILA Specification. The next step is to report this completion.

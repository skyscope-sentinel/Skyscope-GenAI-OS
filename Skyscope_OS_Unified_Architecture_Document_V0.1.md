# Skyscope OS Unified Architecture Document V0.1

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Vision
Skyscope OS aims to be a next-generation operating system, emphasizing unparalleled security, efficiency, and seamless AI integration from the ground up. It is designed for a future where computing is intelligent, adaptive, and inherently secure against emerging threats, including those from quantum computers.

### 1.2. Purpose
This document (Version 0.1) serves as the initial, high-level architectural blueprint for Skyscope OS. It synthesizes the foundational design outputs from key specialist roles (Microkernel Architect, Filesystem Engineer, AI Pipeline Specialist) to provide a unified vision of the core OS components and their interplay. It will guide subsequent detailed design and development efforts.

## 2. Core Architectural Pillars

### 2.1. Microkernel (Based on Skyscope_OS_Microkernel_Design_Specification.md)
The Skyscope OS microkernel is built upon the principles of **minimality, formal verifiability, and capability-based security**, drawing direct inspiration from seL4.
*   **Minimality:** A drastically reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to minimize attack surface and complexity.
*   **Formal Verifiability:** The ultimate goal is to achieve mathematical proof of correctness for the core microkernel.
*   **Capability-Based Security:** All resource access and operations are mediated by capabilities, enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege throughout the system.
*   **IPC:** Synchronous Protected Procedure Calls (PPCs) via endpoints are the primary IPC mechanism.
*   **Services:** Core services include IPC, memory management (via untyped memory and capabilities), scheduling (supporting real-time/fair-share, inspired by seL4 MCS), thread management, and the capability system itself. Higher-level OS functions are user-space servers.
*   **Extensions:** Zircon-inspired extensions will be evaluated cautiously, prioritizing preservation of minimality, verifiability, and security.

### 2.2. PQC Filesystem (Based on PQC_Filesystem_Encryption_Protocol_Specification_V0.1.md)
The filesystem in Skyscope OS is designed for inherent security and integrity, particularly against quantum threats, and will feature AI-driven optimizations.
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Core to its design, employing NIST-selected/finalist algorithms:
    *   **Encryption:** ML-KEM (Kyber) for file content (via per-file/block keys). HQC as backup.
    *   **Signatures:** ML-DSA (Dilithium) or FALCON for metadata, logs, and versioning. SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) as backup.
    *   **Hashing:** SHA3 for Merkle trees.
*   **Unmodifiability (Conceptual):** The filesystem will operate on append-only principles for critical data and metadata, with changes forming new versions, enhancing integrity and auditability.
*   **Integrity:** Merkle trees constructed with SHA3 and a PQC-signed root hash will ensure overall filesystem integrity.
*   **Key Management:** Initial considerations include deriving per-file keys from a master key (PQC KEM protected) and the need for secure vaulting of master PQC keys.

### 2.3. AI Pipeline & Module Management (Based on AI_Pipeline_Module_Management_Initial_Logic_V0.1.md)
Skyscope OS integrates AI deeply through a sophisticated pipeline and distributed module management system.
*   **Modular AI:** AI capabilities are delivered as independent, scalable modules with standardized I/O (e.g., filesystem optimization, generative UI).
*   **AI-Driven Dependency Management:** AI techniques will be explored for intelligent mapping and resolution of dependencies between OS modules, AI models, and datasets.
*   **Distributed Module Management:**
    *   **Versioning:** Semantic Versioning for all OS components.
    *   **Secure Distribution:** All modules are PQC-signed (ML-DSA/FALCON), with signatures verified before loading.
    *   **Repository:** A secure, PQC-protected repository for storing and retrieving versioned modules.

## 3. High-Level Interoperation

*   **Filesystem on Microkernel:** The PQC-secured filesystem will run as one or more user-space servers. It will rely on the microkernel for:
    *   **IPC:** To communicate with applications requesting file operations and potentially with other system services (e.g., a PQC key management vault, also a user-space server).
    *   **Memory Management:** To allocate and manage memory for its operations, file caches, and to map file content into application address spaces securely using kernel-provided frame capabilities.
    *   **Scheduling:** To ensure its threads receive adequate CPU time.
*   **AI Modules & Pipeline on Microkernel:** AI modules will also be user-space processes or services. The AI pipeline orchestrator itself will likely be a privileged user-space service.
    *   **IPC & Capabilities:** AI modules will use IPC for communication. Their access to resources (e.g., specific hardware accelerators, data from the filesystem) will be controlled by capabilities managed by the microkernel.
    *   **Module Management:** The module management system (itself a set of user-space services) will interact with the microkernel to load/unload modules (TCBs, address spaces) and manage their capabilities.
*   **Filesystem & AI Interaction:**
    *   AI modules for filesystem optimization (e.g., predictive caching, data layout) will interact with the filesystem server via IPC.
    *   The filesystem might provide metadata or data access (controlled by capabilities) to specific AI modules for analysis or learning.
*   **PQC Operations:** PQC cryptographic operations (needed by the filesystem and module management for signing/verification) will likely be performed by dedicated, verified libraries within the user-space servers, or potentially by a specialized crypto server if hardware crypto acceleration with PQC support becomes available and can be securely managed by the microkernel.

## 5. Addressing Core Skyscope OS Principles (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Security:** Addressed through the capability-based microkernel, end-to-end PQC for data at rest (filesystem) and module management, and principles of minimality and formal verification.
*   **Efficiency:** The microkernel's minimality and optimized IPC aim for low overhead. Filesystem and AI module designs will need to prioritize performance within their respective domains.
*   **AI-Integration:** The AI pipeline and modular AI design are central to this, allowing AI capabilities to be developed, managed, and deployed as first-class citizens. AI-driven dependency management further deepens this integration.
*   **Interoperability:** Standardized IPC and module interfaces are key.
*   **User-Centricity:** While foundational, these components aim to create a reliable and secure base, which indirectly benefits user experience. Future UI/UX layers will build upon this.

## 6. Identified Gaps or Further Questions (V0.1)

*   **Filesystem-Microkernel PQC Interface:** What are the detailed API requirements for the filesystem server to request/manage memory for PQC operations or to interact with a potential future PQC hardware accelerator via the microkernel? How are PQC keys for the filesystem itself (master keys) protected by the microkernel environment if not using a separate hardware vault?
*   **AI Model Attestation:** What mechanisms will the AI Module Management system use to attest to the integrity and origin of AI models beyond PQC signature verification? E.g., reproducible builds, metadata on training data.
*   **Capability Management for Dynamic AI Modules:** How will capabilities be precisely and dynamically managed (granted, revoked) for AI modules that might be loaded/unloaded frequently or have rapidly changing resource needs?
*   **Detailed IPC Data Formats:** While the mechanism (PPCs) is chosen, the precise data formats and serialization methods for inter-component communication (e.g., between AI modules and the filesystem) need definition.

This V0.1 document provides a starting point. These gaps and questions will be addressed in subsequent design iterations.

# Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression Conceptual Framework - V0.1 - Iteration 1

**Based on:** `Deep_Compression_Conceptual_Framework_V0.1.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Mapping AI Bot roles to SILA ASAs, defining primary SILA IPC interface, initial PQC-friendliness considerations, conceptual self-describing metadata header in SILA.

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from V0.1. This iteration focuses on expressing these principles through the lens of SILA V0.2, as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`.
*   **AI-Bot Driven:** The compression and decompression processes will be managed by specialized **SILA ASAs (Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents)**. Their logic and coordination will be defined using SILA semantic graphs and verifiable contracts.
*   **Extreme Compression Ratio & Speed:** The target remains compressing gigabyte-scale OS components (SILA modules, AI models, large libraries) to under 150MB, with very fast and reliable decompression critical for boot times and on-demand module loading.
*   **Seamless OS Integration & SILA Interfaces:** Deep integration with the OS Loader, Module Management system (AI Pipeline), and SKYAIFS will be achieved via well-defined SILA IPC interfaces.
*   **Adaptive Strategies:** AI Bot ASAs will implement adaptive compression strategies based on data type, usage patterns, and available system resources, with policies defined as SILA `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s.

## 2. AI Bot Roles (as SILA ASAs - Initial Mapping)

The Deep Compression service is envisioned as a cooperative of specialized SILA ASAs:

*   **Analysis & Strategy Bot ASA (ASB_Analyzer):**
    *   **SILA Role:** Acts as the initial processing stage for a compression request.
    *   Receives data analysis requests (e.g., a `SILA_CapToken<SILA_Memory_Region>` pointing to data to be compressed) via SILA IPC.
    *   Utilizes SILA-integrated AI models (invoked via `SILA_Call_AI_Model_Operation` with capabilities to PQC-signed AI model ASAs) to analyze data characteristics (e.g., entropy, structure, known data types like SILA binary metadata).
    *   Selects optimal compression algorithm(s) and parameters from a SILA-defined registry of compression techniques (this registry itself could be a PQC-signed SILA data structure).
    *   Outputs a `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record` (a SILA structure) detailing the chosen strategy (e.g., preprocessing steps, model-based compressor ID, entropy coder choice).
*   **Parallel Processing Bot ASA Coordinator (ASB_Coordinator):**
    *   **SILA Role:** Manages the parallel execution of compression/decompression tasks.
    *   Receives the `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record` (or a decompression request with associated metadata) from the main service interface or `ASB_Analyzer`.
    *   Divides the input data (represented by SILA capabilities to memory regions) into manageable chunks suitable for parallel processing.
    *   Spawns or delegates tasks to multiple `ASB_Worker` ASAs using SILA's concurrent execution patterns (e.g., sending SILA IPC messages to a pool of workers, each message containing a data chunk capability and processing instructions).
    *   Collects results from `ASB_Worker` ASAs and assembles the final compressed/decompressed output.
*   **Worker Compression/Decompression Bot ASA (ASB_Worker):**
    *   **SILA Role:** Performs the core compression/decompression algorithms on data chunks.
    *   Receives a data chunk capability and specific algorithm/parameter instructions (as a SILA Record) from the `ASB_Coordinator`.
    *   The compression/decompression logic itself might be implemented as highly optimized SILA graph segments or, for performance-critical sections, calls to PQC-audited low-level SILA primitives or trusted non-SILA libraries wrapped by a secure SILA interface (if permitted by strict security policy and formal verification of the wrapper).
    *   Reports the result (e.g., a capability to the processed chunk, status) back to the `ASB_Coordinator` via SILA IPC.
*   **Integrity Verification Bot ASA (ASB_Integrity):**
    *   **SILA Role:** Ensures data integrity throughout the process.
    *   Calculates PQC-secure hashes (e.g., using `SILA_PQC_Hash_Operation<SHA3_512_SILA_Enum>`) of original data before compression and of decompressed data after decompression.
    *   Verifies integrity by comparing computed hashes against trusted hashes stored in the `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` accompanying the compressed data. Reports discrepancies via SILA IPC to the `ASB_Coordinator` or a system alert ASA.
*   **Resource Management Bot ASA (ASB_ResourceManager):**
    *   **SILA Role:** Monitors and manages system resource usage by the Deep Compression ASAs.
    *   May query the SILA Microkernel (using authorized `SILA_CapToken`s and `SILA_Reflect_GetResourceUsage_Op`-like operations) for CPU/memory load.
    *   Can adjust the degree of parallelism (e.g., number of active `ASB_Worker` instances) or queue incoming compression/decompression requests based on SILA-defined resource policies (`SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`) to prevent system overload.

## 3. Primary SILA IPC Service Interface

The Deep Compression service, itself likely a primary SILA ASA (or a facade ASA coordinating the internal bots), will expose a formal SILA IPC interface. This interface will be defined by a `SILA_Interface_Specification_Record` and its endpoint will be a well-known `SILA_CapToken`.

*   **`SILA_DeepCompress_Request_Record` Message (SILA Record for IPC):**
    `{
      request_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      data_to_compress_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_Memory_Region_Type>, // Capability to memory region holding data
      compression_policy_hints_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record>>, // Optional hints like desired ratio/speed balance, data type
      reply_to_ep_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_IPC_Endpoint_Type> // Endpoint capability to send the asynchronous response to
    }`
*   **`SILA_DeepCompress_Response_Record` Message (SILA Record for IPC):**
    `{
      original_request_id_ref: SILA_UniqueID_String, // Correlates to the request
      status: SILA_CompressionStatus_Enum { Success_EnumVal, Failure_EnumVal, InProgress_EnumVal },
      compressed_data_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_Memory_Region_Compressed_Type>>, // Capability to memory region holding compressed data
      metadata_header_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record>>, // Capability to the metadata for this compressed data
      error_info_rec: SILA_Optional<SILA_Error_Record> // Detailed error if status is Failure
    }`
*   **`SILA_DeepDecompress_Request_Record` Message (SILA Record for IPC):**
    `{
      request_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      data_to_decompress_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_Memory_Region_Compressed_Type>, // Capability to compressed data
      metadata_header_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record>, // Must be provided by caller
      reply_to_ep_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_IPC_Endpoint_Type>
    }`
*   **`SILA_DeepDecompress_Response_Record` Message (SILA Record for IPC):**
    `{
      original_request_id_ref: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      status: SILA_DecompressionStatus_Enum { Success_EnumVal, Failure_IntegrityCheck_EnumVal, Failure_AlgorithmMismatch_EnumVal, Failure_Resource_EnumVal, InProgress_EnumVal },
      decompressed_data_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_Memory_Region_Type>>, // Capability to memory holding decompressed data
      error_info_rec: SILA_Optional<SILA_Error_Record>
    }`

## 4. Data Structures & Algorithms (Conceptual - PQC Friendliness Focus)

*   **Context-Aware Preprocessing & Model-Based Compression:** Retained from V0.1 framework. These will be implemented as SILA graph logic within `ASB_Analyzer` or specialized `ASB_Worker` ASAs. AI models used for model-based compression will be PQC-signed SILA modules themselves, accessed via capabilities.
*   **PQC-Friendly Entropy Coding (Initial Thoughts for Iteration 1):**
    *   **Challenge:** Many advanced entropy coders (e.g., arithmetic, ANS) create strong statistical dependencies across the entire data stream. If the compressed stream needs to be partially PQC-signed or PQC-encrypted (e.g., if different chunks have different security labels or need independent verification), these dependencies can be problematic for cryptographic agility or can leak information.
    *   **Consideration 1 (Block-Independent Entropy Coding):** Research or develop variants of entropy coders that can operate effectively on smaller, independent blocks of data. Each block could then be individually PQC-processed if needed. This might involve a small trade-off in compression ratio for cryptographic flexibility.
    *   **Consideration 2 (PQC Alignment for Symmetric Encryption):** If the compressed data (or parts of it) is to be symmetrically encrypted (e.g., using AES-256-GCM, with the key wrapped by a PQC KEM like MLKEM_1024), the output of the entropy coder might need padding or structuring to align with the block size and nonce requirements of the symmetric cipher. The `ASB_Worker` ASAs would be responsible for this, guided by SILA policies.
    *   **SILA ADK Task:** Specialist AI agents within the Deep Compression sub-team will be tasked by the Lead to research and prototype (conceptually in SILA) PQC-friendly entropy coding approaches during subsequent iterations.
*   **Progressive Decompression:** Retained. The `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` will need to support chunking information for this.

## 5. Self-Describing Format (Conceptual SILA Metadata Header)

A `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` (itself a SILA Record, PQC-signed by the `ASB_Coordinator` that finalized the compression) would conceptually contain:
`SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record {
  header_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String, // Version of this metadata structure
  compression_plan_summary_record_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionPlan_Summary_Record>, // Capability to a detailed plan structure
  // SILA_CompressionPlan_Summary_Record contains:
  //   preprocessing_steps_array: SILA_Array<SILA_PreprocessingTechnique_Enum>,
  //   model_based_compressor_agent_id_cap_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<ASA_Type>>, // Cap to the AI model ASA used
  //   entropy_coder_algorithm_enum: SILA_EntropyCoderAlgorithm_Enum
  original_data_pqc_hash: SILA_PQC_Hash_Record<SHA3_512_SILA_Enum>, // PQC Hash of the uncompressed data
  compressed_data_pqc_hash: SILA_PQC_Hash_Record<SHA3_512_SILA_Enum>, // PQC Hash of the compressed data payload (excluding this header)
  chunk_descriptors_array_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_Array<SILA_CompressedChunk_Descriptor_Record>>, // For parallelism or progressive decompression
  // SILA_CompressedChunk_Descriptor_Record: { chunk_offset_int, chunk_length_int, chunk_pqc_hash, chunk_specific_params_opt }
  decompression_agent_policy_hints_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_DecompressionPolicy_Record>>, // Hints for resource allocation, parallelism for decompressor
  pqc_signature_of_header: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5> // Signature using a trusted Deep Compression service key
}`

## 6. Integration Points
Retained from V0.1 framework. Interactions with OS Loader, AI Pipeline's Module Management system, and SKYAIFS will utilize the primary SILA IPC service interface defined in Section 3. For example, SKYAIFS would call the decompress operation when a compressed file block is read.

## Iteration 1 Conclusion
This first iteration has laid the groundwork for a SILA V0.2-based Deep Compression framework by:
1.  Mapping the AI Bot roles to specific SILA ASA concepts.
2.  Defining the primary SILA IPC interface (request/response SILA Records) for the Deep Compression service.
3.  Initiating considerations for PQC-friendliness in the context of entropy coding and potential pre-encryption of data segments.
4.  Outlining a conceptual PQC-signed SILA Record structure for the self-describing metadata header.
The ambitious goals of extreme compression ratios (GBs to <150MB) and very fast, reliable decompression remain the central drivers. Subsequent iterations will need to delve deeper into the conceptual algorithms, the SILA logic of the worker ASAs, and the specifics of adaptive strategy selection by the `ASB_Analyzer`.The file `Deep_Compression_Framework_V0.1.iter1.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 1 for the Deep Compression Conceptual Framework. The next step is to report this completion.

**Iteration Focus:** Security policies for dynamic module management in integrated/containerized contexts, SILA contracts for security enforcement, Deep Compression security integration, refined formal verification targets. PQC min 4096-bit equivalent security (e.g., NIST PQC Level V algorithms like Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) is baseline.

## 1. Introduction
Retained from Iteration 1. This iteration of the `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy` expands on policies governing the dynamic lifecycle of SILA modules and services, especially within the context of integrated core components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline) and the SILA containerization framework. It also details security integration with the Deep Compression service and refines formal verification targets, all in alignment with V0.2 design specifications.

## 2. Security Policies for Integrated SILA IPC
Retained and refined from Iteration 1. Core policies IS-IPC-001 (Data Integrity & Confidentiality with PQC), IS-IPC-002 (Capability Validation in IPC), and IS-IPC-003 (DoS Resistance for Endpoints) are foundational.

## 3. SILA Containerization Security Policies
Retained and refined from Iteration 1. Core policies CS-ISO-001 (Default Deny Inter-Container Access), CS-NS-001 (Namespace Integrity & Verification), CS-RES-001 (Resource Quota Enforcement by Microkernel), and CS-IMG-001 (Container Image Authenticity & Integrity Chain) are foundational.

## 4. Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers
Refined examples from Iteration 1, such as FV-INT-001 (Microkernel Lock Manager ASA logic), FV-CON-001 (Container Interlink ASA channel setup), and FV-CON-002 (Microkernel Namespace Filtering logic). Additional targets are identified in section 10.

## 5. PQC Application in Integrated Systems
Retained from Iteration 1. Minimum 4096-bit PQC equivalent security (NIST PQC Level V) is the unwavering standard for all cryptographic operations, including those related to SILA IPC, container image signing, and protection of persistent state or configurations. SILA V0.2's PQC-aware types and cryptographic primitives are instrumental in enforcing this.

## 6. Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS
Retained from Iteration 1, including Threat Vector TV-INT-001 (Compromise of a Core Integration/Mediation SILA ASA). The threat landscape is continuously re-evaluated as dynamic module management and deep compression interactions are detailed.

## 7. Security Policies for Dynamic Module Management (Integrated & Containerized Context - New Detail for Iteration 2)

Reference: `Documentation/AI_Pipeline_Module_Management/SILA_Pipeline_Microkernel_Integration_Spec_V0.2.md` (for dynamic update protocol using `ServiceRegistry_ASA`).

*   **Policy DM-AUTH-001 (Strict Authorization for Dynamic Updates - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   Dynamic updates (load, unload, replace) of SILA modules that provide core OS services (e.g., a Microkernel helper ASA used by SKYAIFS) or are running within active SILA containers **must** be authorized by a "SystemConfigurationAuthority_ASA". This ASA is a highly privileged, formally verified SILA entity.
    *   The requesting SILA ASA (e.g., `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA`) must present a valid, non-revoked `SILA_CapToken<CanManage_CoreServices_Privilege_Type>` or `SILA_CapToken<CanManage_ContainerLifecycle_Privilege_Type>` to the Authority ASA.
    *   The update request itself (a SILA Record detailing the module, version, and target environment) must be PQC-signed by the requesting ASA and verified by the Authority ASA against a registered public key.
*   **Policy DM-STATE-001 (Secure State Migration for Dynamic Updates - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   If a dynamic update of a stateful SILA service ASA involves state migration between the old and new versions:
        *   The SILA IPC channel used for transferring the `SILA_StateSnapshot_Record_Cap` (as conceptualized in Pipeline-Microkernel Integration Spec) **must** be PQC-encrypted (e.g., using ML-KEM key agreement for a session key) and mutually authenticated using SILA capabilities.
        *   The `SILA_StateSnapshot_Record` itself **must** be PQC-signed by the exporting (old version) ASA and its signature **must** be verified by the importing (new version) ASA using a trusted key.
        *   The `SILA_Module_Contract_Record` for both the old and new module versions **must** explicitly define compatible and secure state migration SILA interfaces (e.g., `ExportState_SILA_Operation` and `ImportState_SILA_Operation`). The SILA Verifier should, where possible, check for compatibility between these interface specifications (e.g., matching data types, PQC policies for state data).
*   **Policy DM-RES-001 (Atomic Resource Management during Updates - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   The Microkernel (when handling requests from `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA`) must ensure that resources (memory, capabilities, TCBs) used by an old module version are securely and completely reclaimed **only after** the new version is confirmed operational by the ModuleManager (e.g., successful initialization and health check) AND client redirection via the `ServiceRegistry_ASA` is complete.
    *   In case an update fails mid-process (as per error handling in Pipeline-Microkernel Integration Spec), the Microkernel must support the ModuleManager in rolling back resource allocations for the failed new version and ensuring the old version's resources remain intact until it's safely decommissioned. This prevents resource leaks or conflicts.
*   **Policy DM-CONT-001 (Containerized Module Update Constraints - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   Updating a SILA module *within* a running SILA container must not compromise the container's established isolation boundaries (namespaces, capability scope) or allow it to exceed its existing resource quotas as defined in its `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record`.
    *   The `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record` (or an associated `SILA_ContainerUpdate_Policy_Record` capability) might specify policies regarding whether in-place updates of modules within a container are permitted, or if such updates require a full container restart (instantiation of a new container with the updated module). This choice depends on the criticality of the service and the nature of the module.

## 8. SILA Contracts for Security Enforcement in Integration/Containers (Examples V0.1.iter2 Update)

*   **Example: Microkernel's `SILA_Microkernel_InstantiateContainer_FromDescriptor_Operation` Contract (Security Invariant for Isolation):**
    *   Within its `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`, under the `security_invariants_sila_array` field:
        *   `"Invariant ID_CON_ISO_001: A SILA_Container_Runtime_Object_Type capability created by this operation MUST NOT grant, nor allow derivation of, capabilities that provide direct access to raw Microkernel CSpaces, VSpaces, or arbitrary physical memory outside the container's policy-defined memory quotas."` (Checked by SILA Verifier against Microkernel's SILA implementation).
        *   `"Invariant ID_CON_ISO_002: Initial SILA capabilities endowed to a container's root process(es) MUST be a strict subset of those specified in the PQC-verified `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record`'s `initial_capabilities_to_grant_to_root_process_array` AND further restricted by any overriding global system security policy. No ambient privileges shall be granted."`
        *   `"Invariant ID_CON_PQC_001: The PQC signature on the input `descriptor_to_instantiate_cap` (pointing to a `SILA_Container_Descriptor_Record`) MUST be successfully verified against a trusted 'System_ContainerManagementAuthority_PublicKey_CapToken' before any resource allocation or module loading occurs."`
*   **Example: "System_ContainerInterlink_ASA" Contract (Security Policy Enforcement for IPC Setup):**
    *   Within its `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`, its `operational_policies_ref_cap` points to a `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` that includes rules like:
        *   `SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap for Rule "DenyUnauthorizedInterlink":
            Trigger: On receiving `SILA_Request_InterContainer_Channel_Msg_Record`.
            Condition (SILA Predicate Graph): 
              NOT (
                (SourceContainerDescriptor.allowed_ipc_peers includes TargetService AND TargetContainerDescriptor.exports_service_to includes SourceContainerType) 
                AND 
                (SystemWideInterContainerPolicy.allows_interaction(SourceContainerType, TargetContainerType, TargetService))
              )
            Action: DenyRequest_With_PolicyViolationError.
          }`
        *   This rule, expressed as a verifiable SILA predicate graph, is checked by the SILA Verifier against the Interlink ASA's implementation.

## 9. Deep Compression Security Integration Policies (New Detail for Iteration 2)

Reference: `Documentation/Deep_Compression/Deep_Compression_Framework_V0.2.md` and module loading protocols in `Documentation/AI_Pipeline_Module_Management/SILA_Pipeline_Microkernel_Integration_Spec_V0.2.md`.

*   **Policy DC-INT-001 (End-to-End PQC Integrity for Compressed Data - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   When a SILA module is compressed by the `AI_Pipeline_CompressionAgent_ASA` (which uses the `DeepCompressionService_ASA`): The PQC hash of the *original, uncompressed* SILA module binary **must** be securely calculated and stored in the `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` (which is then PQC-signed).
    *   When the `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` requests decompression from `DeepCompressionService_ASA` as part of module loading:
        1.  The `DeepCompressionService_ASA` (specifically its `ASB_Integrity` bot) **must** first verify the PQC signature of the incoming `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record`.
        2.  It then verifies the integrity of the compressed data stream against the `compressed_data_pqc_hash` stored within that verified header.
        3.  After successful decompression, the `DeepCompressionService_ASA` **must** compute the PQC hash of the *resulting decompressed* SILA binary.
        4.  This newly computed hash of the decompressed binary is returned to the `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` along with the `decompressed_data_cap`.
        5.  The `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` (or the `Microkernel_ProcessManager_ASA` before final loading) **must** then verify this computed hash against the authoritative `original_data_pqc_hash` that was stored in the PQC-signed `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record`.
    *   This multi-step PQC hash verification ensures that the compression/decompression cycle was integrity-preserving and that the decompressed data matches the original data that was intended to be compressed.
*   **Policy DC-RES-001 (Resource Quotas for Deep Compression Service - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   The `DeepCompressionService_ASA`, when invoked by critical system services like `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` (for system module loading) or SKYAIFS ASAs (for file operations), **must** operate under strict resource quotas (CPU, memory, number of worker ASAs) enforced by the Microkernel.
    *   These quotas are defined by a `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` specifically for the `DeepCompressionService_ASA` when handling requests from privileged system components. This policy is managed by the `ASB_ResourceManager` within the Deep Compression framework but can be influenced by system-wide orchestration policies.
    *   This prevents a malformed or maliciously crafted compressed file (e.g., a "zip bomb" equivalent) or a DoS attack targeting the Deep Compression service from exhausting system resources and impacting overall OS stability or the ability to load critical modules.
*   **Policy DC-PQC-001 (Metadata Security & Trust - V0.1.iter2 Update):**
    *   The `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` **must** always be PQC-signed by the entity that performed the compression (e.g., the AI Pipeline's `CompressionAgent_ASA` using a specific `SILA_CapToken<PQC_SigningKey_Type>`).
    *   The `DeepCompressionService_ASA` (specifically its `ASB_Integrity` bot) **must** verify this signature using a trusted public key (capability) for the AI Pipeline's Compression Agent before parsing or acting upon any information within the header. This prevents attacks using maliciously crafted metadata headers.

## 10. Refined Formal Verification Targets (Examples V0.1.iter2 Update)

*   **Dynamic Module Update Protocol (`ServiceRegistry_ASA` & `ModuleManager_ASA` Logic):** The SILA state machines and complex SILA IPC handling logic of the `ServiceRegistry_ASA` and the `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` for managing client redirection, old version retirement, new version activation, and rollback procedures during dynamic module updates must be formally verified for correctness, to prevent service disruption, client misdirection, or inconsistent system state.
*   **Container Lifecycle Capability Management (Microkernel SILA Logic):** The SILA logic within the Microkernel that manages the lifecycle of all SILA capabilities associated with a specific `SILA_Container_Runtime_Object_Type` (i.e., capabilities created during container instantiation, including initial process capabilities, namespace policy capabilities, resource quota capabilities, and any capabilities granted to the container dynamically) must be formally verified. This includes proving that all such capabilities are correctly and completely revoked and their associated resources reclaimed when `SILA_Microkernel_TerminateContainer_Operation` is successfully executed.
*   **Deep Compression Integrity Check Flow (ASB_Integrity & ASB_Coordinator SILA):** The end-to-end SILA logic for Policy DC-INT-001, involving `ASB_Integrity` and `ASB_Coordinator`, including PQC hash computation steps, comparison, and error reporting on mismatch, must be formally verified to ensure its correctness and that it cannot be bypassed.

## Iteration 2 Conclusion
This iteration has focused on integrating security policies more deeply into the dynamic aspects of Skyscope OS, particularly for module management within integrated and containerized environments. This includes defining policies for authorization of updates, secure state migration using PQC-secured channels and data, and atomic resource management during these transitions. Examples of how `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s can be used to specify and enforce security invariants for critical services like container creation and inter-container IPC setup have been provided. Furthermore, crucial security integration policies for the Deep Compression service have been detailed, emphasizing end-to-end data integrity through multi-stage PQC hash verification. Formal verification targets have been refined to include complex dynamic update protocols and critical aspects of container capability lifecycle management.The file `Documentation/Security_Policies/SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1.iter2.md` has been successfully created with the specified content.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 2 for the SILA Integration & Container Security Policy. The next step is to report this completion.

**Iteration Focus:** Threat modeling for integrated SILA services, security policies for SILA ADK usage, PQC key management for containerized services, formal verification of information flow control. PQC min 4096-bit equivalent security (e.g., NIST PQC Level V algorithms like Kyber-1024, Dilithium-5) is baseline.

## 1. Introduction
Retained from Iteration 2. This iteration of the `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy` further deepens the threat analysis for complex interactions between integrated SILA services and expands governance to the SILA development lifecycle itself (ADK usage). It also details PQC key management strategies specific to containerized SILA services and introduces formal verification requirements for information flow control, ensuring alignment with SILA V0.2 and the V0.2 designs of core OS components.

## 2. Security Policies for Integrated SILA IPC
Retained and refined from Iteration 2. Core policies IS-IPC-001 (Data Integrity & Confidentiality with PQC), IS-IPC-002 (Capability Validation in IPC), and IS-IPC-003 (DoS Resistance for Endpoints) remain fundamental and are now assumed to be applied to all inter-component SILA IPC protocols defined in the V0.2 integration specifications.

## 3. SILA Containerization Security Policies
Retained and refined from Iteration 2. Core policies CS-ISO-001 (Default Deny Inter-Container Access), CS-NS-001 (Namespace Integrity & Verification), CS-RES-001 (Resource Quota Enforcement by Microkernel), and CS-IMG-001 (Container Image Authenticity & Integrity Chain) are foundational and are now assumed to be applied based on the V0.2 SILA Containerization Concept.

## 4. Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers
Refined examples from Iteration 2 (e.g., FV-INT-001 for Microkernel Lock Manager ASA, FV-CON-001 for Container Interlink ASA, FV-CON-002 for Microkernel PID Namespace Filtering) are carried forward. New requirements are added in section 12.

## 5. PQC Application in Integrated Systems
Retained from Iteration 2. The minimum 4096-bit PQC equivalent security standard is consistently applied.

## 6. Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS (Expanded for Iteration 3)

Building on TV-INT-001 (Compromise of Core Integration ASA from Iteration 1 & 2):

*   **TV-INT-002: SILA IPC Replay/Spoofing Attacks on Inter-Component Interfaces:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker (e.g., a compromised SILA module with limited network visibility, or a malicious SILA container that has bypassed some local restrictions) captures legitimate SILA IPC messages exchanged between critical core OS ASAs (e.g., `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` <-> `Microkernel_StorageService_ASA`, or `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA` <-> `Microkernel_ProcessManager_ASA`). The attacker then attempts to replay these messages out of context, or crafts new messages attempting to spoof a legitimate sender's SILA capability fingerprint if any part of the capability validation is flawed.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to unauthorized operations (e.g., re-issuing a block write, re-requesting a module load), data corruption if operations are not idempotent, or denial of service by flooding queues with replayed requests.
    *   **SILA-based Mitigations (Reinforced by SILA V0.2 features):**
        *   **Mandatory Unique Transaction IDs:** All critical inter-component SILA IPC protocols (as defined in V0.2 integration specs) **must** use unique, cryptographically generated (e.g., PQC-hash of message content + nonce) transaction IDs within PQC-signed message wrappers. Receiving ASAs must maintain a short-term cache of recently processed transaction IDs to detect and reject replays. SILA contracts on these service endpoints must specify this requirement.
        *   **SILA Capability System:** True spoofing of a `SILA_CapToken` (which is an unforgeable, opaque kernel-managed reference) is considered impossible by SILA V0.2 design. The threat lies in the misuse of legitimately obtained but overly permissive capabilities, or flaws in the logic that validates the *context* of a capability's use.
        *   **Strict Endpoint Capability Scoping:** The Microkernel must ensure that SILA IPC endpoint capabilities are strictly scoped and non-transferable between different security domains (e.g., containers, different privilege-level ASAs) unless explicitly authorized by a secure policy and mediated by a trusted SILA ASA (like the `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA`).
        *   **Authenticated Channels:** Where appropriate, SILA IPC channels between critical system ASAs should be mutually authenticated using PQC key exchange (e.g., ML-KEM to establish session keys) at channel setup, with session keys used for message integrity/encryption.

*   **TV-INT-003: Resource Exhaustion via Shared Critical Integration Service (Deepened):**
    *   **Description:** Multiple client ASAs (e.g., numerous SKYAIFS AI bots, several containerized applications simultaneously requesting module loads via `AI_Pipeline_ModuleManager_ASA`, which in turn calls `DeepCompressionService_ASA`) make a high volume of individually valid requests to a shared, critical integration service. This could be the Microkernel's Lock Manager, the `DeepCompressionService_ASA`, or the `System_KeyVault_ASA`. The target service's internal resources (SILA message queues, memory for state, CPU quota, worker ASA pool) become exhausted, leading to Denial of Service for other legitimate clients.
    *   **SILA-based Mitigations (Reinforced by SILA V0.2 features):**
        *   **Service-Side Rate Limiting & Fair Queuing:** The shared service ASA itself (e.g., `DeepCompressionService_ASA`) **must** implement internal rate limiting and fair queuing algorithms for incoming requests. These algorithms should differentiate requests based on the client's SILA capability (or its embedded PQC-verified identity/priority tags). Policies for this are defined in the service's `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`.
        *   **Microkernel Resource Quotas on Service ASAs:** The Microkernel **must** enforce overall resource quotas (CPU, memory, TCB count) on the shared service ASAs themselves, preventing any single service from destabilizing the entire system. These quotas are part of the service's deployment manifest.
        *   **Client-Side Throttling (ADK Patterns):** AI agents developing client ASAs **must** use SILA ADK-provided patterns that include client-side request throttling, circuit breakers, and appropriate timeout/retry logic for calls to shared system services. `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s for services should advertise rate limit recommendations.
        *   **SILA Asynchronous Operations:** Extensive use of SILA's asynchronous operations (`SILA_Async_Job_ID_Record` based calls) for long-running service requests allows client ASAs to avoid blocking and manage timeouts effectively.

*   **TV-CONT-001: Container Breakout via Kernel Exploit in Shared SILA Primitives (Reaffirmed):**
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in a core Microkernel SILA primitive that is used by containerized SILA processes (e.g., a flaw in the SILA IPC message passing implementation, memory mapping operations, or namespace filtering logic) is exploited by a specially crafted SILA program within a container. This exploit aims to gain unauthorized access to host Microkernel capabilities, other containers' resources, or to escalate privileges.
    *   **SILA-based Mitigations (Reinforced by SILA V0.2 features):**
        *   **Formal Verification of Core Primitives:** These Microkernel SILA primitives (especially those exposed to containers) are the absolute highest priority for formal verification using the SILA Verifier against their `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s.
        *   **SILA Language Design:** SILA V0.2's design principles (strong type safety, capability system, no raw memory pointers accessible to typical ASAs, verifiable contracts) are intended to minimize the possibility of such vulnerabilities.
        *   **Defense-in-Depth:** Multiple layers of SILA capability checks at different points (e.g., IPC send, IPC receive, resource access) should ensure that even if one check is flawed, others might catch the violation.
        *   **Restricted Microkernel Interface for Containers:** The set of Microkernel SILA operations exposed to containerized processes should be the minimal subset necessary for their operation.

## 7. Security Policies for Dynamic Module Management
Retained and refined from Iteration 2 (DM-AUTH-001, DM-STATE-001, DM-RES-001, DM-CONT-001). These policies ensure authorized, secure, and resource-controlled updates of SILA modules in integrated and containerized contexts.

## 8. SILA Contracts for Security Enforcement
Retained and refined from Iteration 2. `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s are key for specifying security invariants and policy adherence for critical ASAs like the Microkernel's container creation operation or the `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA`.

## 9. Deep Compression Security Integration Policies
Retained and refined from Iteration 2 (DC-INT-001 for end-to-end PQC integrity, DC-RES-001 for resource limits on DC service, DC-PQC-001 for metadata security).

## 10. Security Policies for SILA ADK Usage in Integrated Development (New Section for Iteration 3)

These policies govern how AI agents use the SILA Agent Development Kit (ADK) when developing SILA modules that will be part of the integrated Skyscope OS or run within its containers. Reference: `Documentation/AI_Pipeline_Module_Management/SILA_AI_Pipeline_ADK_Tooling_Concepts_V0.1.md` (and its V0.2 evolution).

*   **Policy ADK-SEC-001 (Mandatory Formal Verification Pre-Commit/Pre-Integration):**
    *   Any SILA semantic graph generated or significantly modified by an AI agent using the ADK that is intended for use in security-critical OS components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, Security Services, Core AI Pipeline Services, Container Management ASAs) **must** successfully pass a predefined suite of formal verification checks *before* it can be proposed for commit to the main development branch or integration into a system build.
    *   These checks are invoked via `sila_adk.verifier_invoke_with_system_policy_suite_Op(graph_ref_cap, critical_module_policy_suite_cap)`. The policy suite capability points to a set of relevant `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s and global security policies (like information flow, PQC usage) that the module must adhere to.
*   **Policy ADK-SEC-002 (Secure SILA Capability Handling Patterns & Anti-Patterns):**
    *   AI agents **must** primarily use ADK-provided, PQC-signed, and verified SILA patterns for common capability operations: requesting new capabilities, deriving capabilities (with strict adherence to the Principle of Least Privilege by requesting only minimal necessary rights), securely passing capabilities via SILA IPC, and ensuring timely revocation/destruction of capabilities when no longer needed.
    *   The ADK's SILA graph generation tools should actively prevent or flag known insecure capability handling anti-patterns (e.g., overly broad capability requests, storing capabilities in insecure ways, not checking rights on received capabilities). Direct manipulation of raw SILA capability representations (if even exposed by SILA V0.2's lowest layers) is strictly forbidden for general OS component development.
*   **Policy ADK-SEC-003 (PQC Usage Compliance & Best Practices):**
    *   The SILA ADK **must** ensure that any PQC-aware SILA types or PQC primitive operations generated or configured by AI agents strictly conform to the system-wide PQC security level (min 4096-bit equivalent, e.g., MLKEM_1024, MLDSA_5) and key management policies (as per section 11 below).
    *   The ADK may restrict AI agents from selecting non-compliant PQC algorithms or insecure parameter sets (e.g., weak curves, insufficient hash lengths for signatures). It should guide agents to use PQC algorithms appropriate for the specific security goal (e.g., KEMs for confidentiality, Digital Signatures for integrity/authenticity).
*   **Policy ADK-SEC-004 (AI Pipeline Enforcement & Re-Verification):**
    *   The AI Pipeline's CI/CD workflow for SILA modules **must** independently re-verify these ADK usage policies upon commit/ingestion of new SILA code.
    *   The pipeline will reject commits where AI agents appear to have bypassed ADK validation steps (e.g., if ADK-inserted verification metadata is missing or tampered with) or where the generated SILA code, despite potential local ADK checks, violates fundamental system-wide security invariants detectable by the master `SILA_VerifierService_ASA`. This ensures that even if an AI agent's local ADK environment or policies are outdated or compromised, the central pipeline provides a robust security gate.

## 11. PQC Key Management for Containerized SILA Services (New Detail for Iteration 3)

These policies ensure that SILA services running within containers can securely obtain and use PQC keys.

*   **Policy PQC-CONT-001 (Unique Container Instance Identity & Signing Keys):**
    *   Upon successful instantiation by `SILA_Microkernel_InstantiateContainer_FromDescriptor_Operation`, each SILA container instance **must** be endowed by the Microkernel (or a "ContainerIdentity_Service_ASA" called by the Microkernel) with a unique, PQC-signed "Container Instance Identity" capability (`SILA_CapToken<SILA_ContainerInstanceIdentity_Record_Type>`). This identity is unforgeable and specific to that running instance.
    *   This `SILA_ContainerInstanceIdentity_Record_Type` can then be used by authorized ASAs within the container to request specific PQC *signing* key capabilities (e.g., for MLDSA_5) from a "ContainerKeyProvisioning_Service_ASA". This service verifies the container's identity capability and, based on policy (e.g., from the container's descriptor), issues a signing key capability restricted for use only by ASAs within that container.
    *   This allows SILA services running within a container to PQC-sign their outgoing SILA IPC messages or data artifacts, enabling other services (in other containers or the host) to verify their origin as being from a specific, authenticated container instance.
*   **Policy PQC-CONT-002 (Ephemeral PQC Session Key Provisioning for Containers):**
    *   For establishing secure PQC-encrypted communication channels (e.g., for inter-container communication set up by `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA`, or for a containerized service to communicate securely with a host OS service):
        1.  A SILA service ASA within a container requests an ephemeral PQC key pair (e.g., for ML-KEM key establishment) from a system "EphemeralKey_Service_ASA" (which could be the `System_KeyVault_ASA` or a specialized delegate). The request includes its `SILA_ContainerInstanceIdentity_Record_Type` capability for authentication and policy checking.
            `EphemeralKey_Service_ASA_EP_Cap.SILA_Call(
              SILA_Request_EphemeralPQC_KeyPair_Operation_Record {
                key_specification_enum: MLKEM_1024_Ephemeral_KeySpec_SILA_Enum,
                intended_peer_identity_hash_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_PQC_Hash_Record_Type>, // PQC Hash of intended peer's identity for key usage restriction
                session_duration_hint_opt: SILA_Optional<SILA_Duration_Record>
              }
            ) -> SILA_Result_Union<SILA_EphemeralPQC_KeyPair_Caps_Record { public_key_material_cap, private_key_usage_session_cap }, SILA_Error_Record_Cap>`
        2.  The returned `private_key_usage_session_cap` is a highly restricted SILA capability. It allows the containerized ASA to use the private key for a limited time or a limited number of PQC KEM decapsulation operations, specifically with the intended peer (if specified and enforced by the Key Service). This capability **must not** allow direct export or reading of the raw private key bits.
        3.  The `public_key_material_cap` (containing the public key bits as a SILA structure) can be shared with the intended peer (e.g., via the `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA` during channel setup, or directly if a prior authenticated channel exists).
*   **Policy PQC-CONT-003 (Strict Isolation of Private Key Material for Containers):**
    *   The Microkernel and the SILA runtime environment **must** ensure that SILA capabilities granting usage of private PQC key material (whether long-term signing keys or ephemeral session keys) are strictly confined to the authorized SILA container and its constituent ASAs. There must be no mechanism for one container to access or use the private key capabilities of another container. This is a critical formal verification target for the Microkernel's capability management SILA logic.

## 12. Formal Verification for Information Flow Control in Containers (New Requirement Area for Iteration 3)

*   **Requirement IFC-CONT-001 (Verifying Container-to-Container Information Flow Policies):**
    *   For any two SILA containers, Container A and Container B, if a system security policy (defined as a `SILA_InformationFlowPolicy_Definition_Record` as per `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`) dictates that information with a specific "SensitivityLabel_Alpha_SILA_Enum" must not flow from Container A to Container B (either directly or indirectly through other ASAs or storage like SKYAIFS), then the SILA Verifier **must** be able to formally verify this property.
    *   This verification involves analyzing:
        *   The `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s of all SILA ASAs within Container A and Container B, particularly their declared information flow policies and how they handle data with "SensitivityLabel_Alpha_SILA_Enum".
        *   The SILA capabilities granted to Container A and Container B, especially for inter-container IPC via the `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA`.
        *   The SILA logic of any intermediary ASAs (like `System_ContainerInterlink_ASA` or shared SKYAIFS services) to ensure they respect and enforce the information flow labels and policies.
*   **SILA Language and Toolchain Support for Information Flow Verification:**
    *   This relies heavily on SILA V0.2's features for:
        *   Attaching PQC-signed sensitivity labels (as SILA Enum types) to data types and SILA capabilities.
        *   Defining information flow policies within `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`s (e.g., "this ASA only outputs data labeled 'Public' or 'Sanitized' if it receives input labeled 'Secret'").
        *   The SILA Verifier's capability to perform static and potentially dynamic information flow analysis on SILA semantic graphs, tracking how labeled data propagates through ASAs and IPC channels.

## Iteration 3 Conclusion
This iteration has significantly expanded the security policy framework by:
1.  Deepening the **threat model for integrated SILA services**, considering IPC replay/spoofing and resource exhaustion via shared services, and proposing SILA-based mitigations.
2.  Introducing crucial **security policies for AI agent usage of the SILA ADK**, focusing on mandatory pre-commit verification, secure capability handling patterns, and PQC compliance, with AI Pipeline enforcement.
3.  Detailing conceptual **SILA protocols and policies for PQC key management (identity, signing, ephemeral session keys) specifically for containerized SILA services**, emphasizing strict isolation of key material.
4.  Establishing initial formal **verification requirements for information flow control between SILA containers**, leveraging SILA V0.2's data labeling and contract features.
These enhancements aim to build a comprehensive, verifiable security architecture around the integrated and containerized Skyscope OS components.The file `Documentation/Security_Policies/SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1.iter3.md` has been successfully created with the specified content.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 3 for the SILA Integration & Container Security Policy. The next step is to report this completion.

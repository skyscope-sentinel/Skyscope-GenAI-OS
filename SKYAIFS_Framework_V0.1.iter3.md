# SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem) Conceptual Framework - V0.1 - Iteration 3

**Based on:** `SKYAIFS_Framework_V0.1.iter2.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Performance optimization with SILA (caching, parallelism), detailed Deep Compression integration, identifying formal verification targets, refined Supervisor ASA logic.

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from Iteration 2. Implementation relies on SILA V0.2, emphasizing AI-orchestration, PQC-security (min 4096-bit), resilience, and dynamic adaptation.

## 2. Dynamic Block/Sector Management (SILA V0.2 Alignment)
Retained from Iteration 2. This includes `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record` and the "SKYAIFS_AllocationManager_ASA".

## 3. AI Bot Orchestration (SILA V0.2 Implementation)

### 3.1. Bot Representation as SILA ASAs & Interaction Protocols
Retained from Iteration 2. The `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` manages specialized bot ASAs (Defragmentation, Data Relocation, Predictive Placement, Integrity Verification, Caching, etc.) using SILA IPC with PQC-protected message types where appropriate.

### 3.2. Resilience & Self-Healing Logic in SILA
Retained from Iteration 2. This includes redundant metadata storage using SILA quorum write patterns, automated metadata recovery by specialized ASAs, and circuit breaker patterns for failing storage capabilities.

### 3.3. Dynamic Data Relocation Workflow
Retained from Iteration 2. The detailed SILA state machine for the `SKYAIFS_DataRelocationBot_SM` (ValidateThreat, SelectSecureZone, AcquireNewKeys, CopyAndReEncrypt, UpdateMetadataReferences, etc.) forms the basis for its SILA implementation.

### 3.4. Performance Optimization with SILA

#### 3.4.1. AI Bot ASAs for Intelligent Caching
*   **SKYAIFS_CachingSupervisor_ASA:** A dedicated SILA ASA responsible for global caching strategy, policy management (e.g., cache size limits per user/group, PQC considerations for cached data), and coordination of caching/eviction bots.
*   **SKYAIFS_PredictiveCachingBot_ASA:**
    *   **SILA Logic:** This ASA subscribes to file access event streams (SILA messages like `SILA_SKYAIFS_FileOpen_Event`, `SILA_SKYAIFS_BlockRead_Event`) from the main I/O path ASAs.
    *   It uses these events to build an access pattern model (potentially a SILA graph structure or an integrated AI model invoked via `SILA_Call_AI_Model_Operation` as per `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`).
    *   Based on this model, it proactively issues SILA IPC commands to fetch logical blocks:
        `this_asa.SILA_Call(SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA_EP_Cap, SILA_PrefetchBlock_Request { logical_block_id: SILA_UniqueID, target_cache_tier_enum: HighPerformance_Cache })`.
    *   The I/O Path ASA would then handle reading from storage (via Microkernel SILA calls) and decompressing (via Deep Compression SILA calls) into a memory region managed by the Caching Supervisor.
    *   **Cache Representation:** The cache itself is a SILA graph structure managed by the `SKYAIFS_CachingSupervisor_ASA`. It maps a `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_ID_Record` to a `SILA_SKYAIFS_CacheEntry_Record {
          cached_data_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>, // Capability to the memory holding the block data
          original_block_desc_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record>,
          access_count: SILA_Int,
          last_access_time: SILA_Timestamp_Record,
          pqc_decryption_key_for_data_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Key_Object_Type>> // If data is stored encrypted in cache
        }`.
*   **SKYAIFS_AdaptiveEvictionBot_ASA:**
    *   **SILA Logic:** Periodically, or when cache pressure is high (signaled by a SILA event from the Caching Supervisor), this ASA analyzes the `SILA_SKYAIFS_CacheEntry_Record` metadata.
    *   It applies SILA-defined eviction policies. These policies can be complex SILA predicate graphs (e.g., implementing LRU, LFU, or an AI model's output) referenced via a `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record_Cap`.
    *   `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Evaluate_EvictionPolicy_Graph(cache_entry_metadata_cap, eviction_policy_graph_cap) -> SILA_Bool_ShouldEvict`.
    *   If eviction is decided, it informs the Caching Supervisor to release the `cached_data_cap` and update cache metadata.

#### 3.4.2. Parallel I/O Operations with SILA Concurrency
*   For large file reads/writes, or batch operations (e.g., by a backup ASA), the primary `SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA` can leverage SILA's concurrency features (as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`, e.g., actor-like ASAs):
    1.  The I/O Path ASA breaks the request into multiple sub-requests (e.g., ranges of logical blocks).
    2.  It spawns a pool of temporary "SKYAIFS_WorkerIO_ASA" instances or sends messages to a pre-existing pool.
    3.  Each worker ASA receives a SILA message detailing its sub-request (e.g., `SILA_PerformPartialRead_Command { file_handle_cap, block_range_struct, target_buffer_offset }`).
    4.  Worker ASAs execute their partial I/O operations concurrently (each interacting with Microkernel/Deep Compression as needed).
    5.  The primary I/O Path ASA uses a SILA synchronization primitive (e.g., a "SILA_JoinPoint_CapToken" or by counting completion messages) to wait for all worker ASAs to complete their tasks before signaling overall completion to the original requester.
    *   The SILA Verifier would be used to check for potential race conditions or deadlocks in these parallel SILA graph interactions, based on their contracts.

### 3.5. Deep Compression Service Integration (Detailed SILA Interaction)
Interaction with the `SkyscopeSentinel_DeepCompression_Service_ASA`:

*   **Compression on Write (Transparent, from SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA):**
    1.  Data to be written arrives as `uncompressed_data_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>`.
    2.  SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA makes a SILA IPC call:
        `DeepCompression_Service_EP_Cap.SILA_Call(SILA_CompressBlock_Request_Record {
          request_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          data_to_compress_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken<uncompressed_data_cap_Type>, // Pass by capability
          compression_policy_hints_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_SKYAIFS_CompressionPolicy_Record> // Policy from file metadata or SKYAIFS global settings
        }) -> SILA_Async_JobID_Record`
    3.  Deep Compression ASA performs compression, then sends SILA IPC reply/event:
        `SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA_Reply_EP_Cap.SILA_SendEvent(SILA_CompressBlock_Response_Record {
          original_request_id_ref: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          compressed_data_payload_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>, // Cap to memory holding compressed data
          actual_compression_info_record: SILA_CompressionHeader_Struct, // Size, algorithm used, etc.
          status: SILA_OperationStatus_Enum
        })`
    4.  SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA then writes the data from `compressed_data_payload_cap` to storage via Microkernel SILA calls. The `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record` is updated with `actual_compression_info_record` and marked as compressed.

*   **Decompression on Read (Transparent, from SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA):**
    1.  Metadata indicates block is compressed. SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA reads compressed block from storage into `compressed_data_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>`.
    2.  Makes SILA IPC call:
        `DeepCompression_Service_EP_Cap.SILA_Call(SILA_DecompressBlock_Request_Record {
          request_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          compressed_data_ref_cap: SILA_CapToken<compressed_data_cap_Type>,
          decompression_header_info: SILA_CompressionHeader_Struct // From block metadata
        }) -> SILA_Async_JobID_Record`
    3.  Deep Compression ASA performs decompression, then sends SILA IPC reply/event:
        `SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA_Reply_EP_Cap.SILA_SendEvent(SILA_DecompressBlock_Response_Record {
          original_request_id_ref: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          decompressed_data_payload_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryRegion_Type>,
          status: SILA_OperationStatus_Enum
        })`
    4.  SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA then uses the data from `decompressed_data_payload_cap` for the application request.

*   **`SILA_SKYAIFS_CompressionPolicy_Record` Structure:**
    `SILA_SKYAIFS_CompressionPolicy_Record {
      target_compression_level_enum: SILA_CompressionGoal_Enum { MaxSpeed, Balanced, MaxRatio, LosslessOnly },
      latency_budget_ms_optional: SILA_Optional<SILA_Int>,
      pqc_encryption_context_for_compressed_data_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Key_Object_Type>> // If compressed data also needs separate encryption
    }`

### 3.6. Refined SKYAIFS Supervisor ASA Logic
*   The `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` acts as the central policy decision point and coordinator for SKYAIFS.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** It loads and interprets PQC-signed `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`s from a trusted system configuration service. It then distributes relevant sub-policies or policy capabilities to the specialized bot ASAs. For example, it might send a `SILA_UpdateBotOperatingPolicy_Command` to the `SKYAIFS_RelocationBot_ASA` with a new `SILA_CapToken` to an updated relocation trigger policy.
*   **Coordination Example (Integrity Failure -> Relocation):**
    1.  Receives `SILA_IntegrityAnomaly_Detected_Event` from an Integrity Bot ASA.
    2.  Logs the event using a SILA logging service.
    3.  Applies a `SILA_TriagePolicy_Graph` (a SILA predicate graph) to the event to determine severity and required action.
    4.  If relocation is required, it constructs and sends the `SILA_InitiateDataRelocation_Command_Record` to the `SKYAIFS_DataRelocationBot_ASA`, including capabilities to the affected data and relevant policies.
    5.  Monitors for completion/failure events from the Relocation Bot.

## 4. PQC Integration & SILA File Descriptors
Retained from Iteration 2. The refined `SILA_SKYAIFS_OpenFileHandle_Record` (with versioned metadata capabilities and session-specific rights) is key.

## 5. Interface with Microkernel (SILA V0.2 APIs)
Retained from Iteration 2.

## 6. Formal Verification Targets within SKYAIFS (Initial Identification)

1.  **Metadata Update Atomicity Logic (SILA):** The core SILA graph logic within the `SKYAIFS_AllocationManager_ASA` or equivalent, responsible for updating critical filesystem metadata (e.g., file allocation tables/graphs, directory structures), must be formally verified to ensure atomicity or, at minimum, consistency and recoverability (e.g., via PQC-signed journaling implemented in SILA) in the face of simulated faults (e.g., ASA crash, power loss during an update). This involves proving invariants on the SILA metadata graph structures.
2.  **PQC Key Handling for File Blocks (SILA):** The SILA logic within the "SKYAIFS_KeyManager_ASA" (or equivalent service called by SKYAIFS ASAs) for deriving, assigning, storing references to (as capabilities), and authorizing usage of unique PQC encryption keys for individual file blocks must be formally verified. This verification must prove that key capabilities cannot be leaked, that data cannot be accessed with an incorrect key capability, and that key revocation (if applicable) renders data inaccessible as per policy.
3.  **Access Control Enforcement for File Operations (SILA):** The main `SKYAIFS_IOPath_ASA` logic that validates an application-provided `SILA_SKYAIFS_OpenFileHandle_CapToken` against the requested operation (read, write, etc.) and the permissions defined within the referenced (and versioned) `SILA_SKYAIFS_File_Descriptor_Record` must be formally verified. This includes verifying that any policy checks (e.g., time-of-day access from a `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`) are correctly applied.

## Iteration 3 Conclusion
This iteration has substantially advanced the SKYAIFS framework by:
1.  Detailing SILA-based strategies for performance optimization, particularly through AI-driven intelligent caching and parallel I/O operations orchestrated by specialized SKYAIFS ASAs.
2.  Providing more detailed SILA IPC protocols (message structures and interaction sequences) for transparent integration with the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression service, including policy exchange.
3.  Identifying three critical SKYAIFS SILA modules/logic paths (metadata update atomicity, PQC key handling for file blocks, and file operation access control) as prime candidates for formal verification using the SILA Verifier.
4.  Further refining the SILA logic of the `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` concerning policy enforcement and coordination of other bot ASAs.
These enhancements further solidify the path towards a high-performance, secure, and AI-native filesystem implemented in SILA.The file `SKYAIFS_Framework_V0.1.iter3.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 3 for the SKYAIFS Conceptual Framework. The next step is to report this completion.

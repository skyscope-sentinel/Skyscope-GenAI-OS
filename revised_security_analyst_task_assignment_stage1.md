**Subject: Revised Stage 1 Task - Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy V0.1**

**To: Security Analyst**
**From: Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence - AI OS (Orchestrator)**
**Stage: 1 (Revised) - Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design**
**Iteration: 1 (Post-Stage 0)**

**Directive:**

With the introduction of the SILA programming language, SKYAIFS, and the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism, your crucial task is to define the **Initial Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) & SILA Security Policy V0.1**. This foundational document will guide the secure development and implementation of all Skyscope OS components.

**Key Requirements for the Security Policy Document:**

1.  **PQC Algorithm Suite & Key Management Principles:**
    *   Reconfirm and detail the PQC algorithm suite for Skyscope OS, with a strong emphasis on **minimum 4096-bit equivalent security levels** (e.g., for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, FALCON, HQC, SLH-DSA, and secure hashes).
    *   Outline foundational principles for PQC key management (generation, secure storage, distribution, rotation, revocation) applicable to SILA-based components and AI agents. Consider the unique aspects of managing keys for AI bots and SILA's metadata layer.

2.  **SILA Language Security:**
    *   Address security considerations specific to the SILA language:
        *   **Verification of ADK Outputs:** How to ensure SILA code generated by AI agents via the Agent Development Kit (ADK) adheres to security policies and is free from introduced vulnerabilities.
        *   **Protection of SILA Metadata:** Policies for securing the rich metadata layer associated with compiled SILA binaries (e.g., access control, integrity checks).
        *   **SILA Toolchain Security:** Initial thoughts on securing the SILA compiler, verifier, and other toolchain components.

3.  **Security Aspects of SKYAIFS:**
    *   Define security policies related to SKYAIFS operations:
        *   Triggers and authorization for AI bot-driven data relocation (in case of attack/corruption).
        *   Permission models for SKYAIFS AI bots (principle of least privilege).
        *   Integrity and confidentiality of SKYAIFS metadata and logs.

4.  **Security of Deep Compression Mechanism:**
    *   Address security concerns for the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism:
        *   Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of compressed data.
        *   Secure operation of AI bots involved in compression/decompression.
        *   Preventing denial-of-service or resource exhaustion attacks via the compression mechanism.

5.  **Initial OS Threat Model (SILA & AI-Centric):**
    *   Develop an initial high-level threat model for Skyscope OS, considering its unique architecture:
        *   SILA as the core programming language.
        *   AI-orchestrated functionalities (SKYAIFS, Deep Compression, AI Pipeline).
        *   PQC as the cryptographic foundation.
    *   Identify potential new attack surfaces or threat vectors introduced by these novel technologies.

**Output Format:**

*   A structured security policy document (Markdown or similar).
*   This document should provide clear guidelines and identify key areas for ongoing security scrutiny.

**Deliverable:**
*   Commit the 'Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy V0.1' to the designated shared secure repository.

**Deadline:** [To be set by Project Coordinator]

This initial security policy is paramount for embedding security into the DNA of the SILA-based Skyscope OS from the very beginning.

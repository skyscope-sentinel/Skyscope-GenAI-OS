# SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem) Conceptual Framework - V0.2.0 (Final - Iteration 4)

**Based on:** `SKYAIFS_Framework_V0.1.iter3.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**This Version (V0.2.0) Goals:** Introduce advanced AI Bot concepts, SILA-based auditing/forensics, touch on ecosystem integration, and consolidate into a coherent V0.2 framework.

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA V0.2 (as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`) provides the expressive power for realizing these principles. AI-Orchestration, Dynamic Adaptation, Resilience, PQC-Security (min 4096-bit equivalent, e.g., MLKEM_1024, MLDSA_5), and Unmodifiable Core Metadata (versioned SILA graph segments) remain central.

## 2. Dynamic Block/Sector Management (SILA V0.2 Alignment)
Retained from Iteration 3. Managed by the "SKYAIFS_AllocationManager_ASA" using SILA graph structures for free space and `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record` for block representation.

## 3. AI Bot Orchestration (SILA V0.2 Implementation)

### 3.1. Bot Representation as SILA ASAs & Interaction Protocols
Retained from Iteration 3. The `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` orchestrates specialized bot ASAs (Defragmentation, Data Relocation, Predictive Placement, Integrity Verification, Caching, etc.) using SILA IPC, with message payloads being PQC-aware SILA Records.

### 3.2. Resilience & Self-Healing Logic in SILA
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA fault tolerance patterns (ADK-generated Retry, Circuit Breaker, Quorum Write for redundant metadata) and verifiable contracts on bot ASAs are key to achieving resilience.

### 3.3. Dynamic Data Relocation Workflow
Retained from Iteration 3. The detailed SILA State Machine for the `SKYAIFS_DataRelocationBot_SM` (ValidateThreat, SelectSecureZone, AcquireNewKeys, CopyAndReEncrypt, UpdateMetadataReferences, etc.) using SILA capabilities for key management and storage access.

### 3.4. Performance Optimization with SILA
Retained from Iteration 3. AI Bot ASAs for intelligent caching (`SKYAIFS_PredictiveCachingBot_ASA`, `SKYAIFS_AdaptiveEvictionBot_ASA`) and SILA concurrency features for parallel I/O operations by worker ASAs.

### 3.5. Deep Compression Service Integration (Detailed SILA Interaction)
Retained from Iteration 3. Transparent compression/decompression of file blocks via SILA IPC calls (e.g., `SILA_CompressBlock_Request_Record`, `SILA_DecompressBlock_Request_Record`) to the `SkyscopeSentinel_DeepCompression_Service_ASA`, including exchange of `SILA_SKYAIFS_CompressionPolicy_Record`.

### 3.6. Refined SKYAIFS Supervisor ASA Logic
Retained from Iteration 3. The `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` focuses on policy enforcement (distributing `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` capabilities to bots) and coordinating complex cross-bot workflows via SILA state machines and event propagation.

### 3.7. Advanced AI Bot Capabilities (Conceptual - New Section)

#### 3.7.1. SKYAIFS_DataExfiltrationDetectionBot_ASA
*   **Purpose:** To detect anomalous data access patterns that might indicate data exfiltration attempts by SILA processes or agents.
*   **SILA Logic & Operation:**
    *   This ASA subscribes to the `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record` stream (see Section 7) from the "Audit Log Manager" SILA ASA.
    *   It maintains (or queries from a "Behavioral Profile" SILA ASA) dynamic profiles of "normal" file access behavior for critical SILA processes, users, or container capabilities. These profiles are SILA structures, potentially derived from AI models.
    *   It uses a SILA-integrated anomaly detection AI model (invoked via `SILA_Call_AI_Model_Operation` with features extracted from audit events) to identify significant deviations (e.g., a normally dormant SILA service ASA suddenly performing large reads of diverse, rarely accessed files, or accessing data outside its typical operational scope defined by its `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`).
    *   Upon detecting a high-confidence anomaly, it generates a `SILA_PotentialExfiltration_Alert_Record` (a PQC-signed SILA structure) and sends it via secure SILA IPC to the `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA` and the central OS "SecurityOrchestration_Service_ASA".
    *   Its behavior is governed by a `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` that defines sensitivity thresholds, false positive rates, and authorized alert channels.

#### 3.7.2. SKYAIFS_ModuleAwareStorageBot_ASA
*   **Purpose:** To optimize SILA module loading times by attempting to co-locate SILA modules on underlying physical storage if the AI Pipeline indicates they are frequently loaded or used together.
*   **SILA Logic & Operation:**
    *   This ASA receives `SILA_ModuleCoLoading_Hint_Event` messages (SILA Records) from the `AI_Pipeline_ModuleDeployment_ASA`. These hints contain lists of `SILA_Module_Identifier_Record`s that are frequently co-dependent.
    *   The bot then queries SKYAIFS metadata (via SILA IPC to metadata ASAs) to find the `SILA_SKYAIFS_LogicalBlock_Descriptor_Record` capabilities for the files corresponding to these SILA modules.
    *   Based on a SILA policy (considering current storage layout, fragmentation, and potential performance benefits vs. cost of relocation), it may initiate data relocation tasks.
    *   It would request the `SKYAIFS_DataRelocationBot_ASA` (via SILA IPC) to move the relevant logical blocks to more physically contiguous areas (if the underlying storage capabilities managed by the Microkernel allow such fine-grained placement hints).
    *   This is a low-priority background optimization task, heavily governed by SILA policies to prevent negative impacts on foreground filesystem operations. Its effectiveness would be monitored by the `SKYAIFS_Supervisor_ASA`.

## 4. PQC Integration & SILA File Descriptors
Retained from Iteration 3. Minimum 4096-bit equivalent PQC security (e.g., MLKEM_1024, MLDSA_5) is enforced through SILA PQC-aware types. The refined `SILA_SKYAIFS_OpenFileHandle_Record` (with versioned metadata capabilities and session-specific rights) is used for application access.

## 5. Interface with Microkernel (SILA V0.2 APIs)
Retained from Iteration 3. All interactions (storage access, memory allocation, fault reporting) occur via formal SILA IPC and capabilities defined by the Microkernel's SILA interface.

## 6. Formal Verification Targets within SKYAIFS
Retained from Iteration 3:
1.  **Metadata Update Atomicity Logic (SILA):** Ensuring consistency of SILA metadata graphs.
2.  **PQC Key Handling for File Blocks (SILA):** Verifying secure management of PQC key capabilities.
3.  **Access Control Enforcement for File Operations (SILA):** Verifying correct application of permissions via file handle capabilities.

## 7. SILA-based Auditing and Forensics (New Section)

*   **`SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record` Structure (Conceptual Refinement):**
    `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record {
      event_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
      event_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_String, // Version of this audit record structure
      timestamp: SILA_Timestamp_Record, // High-precision, PQC-signed timestamp from a trusted time service ASA
      initiating_agent_chain_caps_fingerprint: SILA_Array<SILA_CapFingerprint_Type>, // Chain of capabilities if action was delegated
      operation_type_enum: SILA_SKYAIFS_Operation_Enum, // e.g., CreateFile, ReadBlock, DeleteMetadata, BotAction_RelocateBlock
      target_object_primary_cap_fingerprint: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapFingerprint_Type>, // Fingerprint of the main file/dir/block capability being acted upon
      target_object_path_string: SILA_Optional<SILA_Path_String_Record>,
      operation_parameters_sila_map: SILA_Map_Record<SILA_String_Record, SILA_Any_Record>, // Structured key-value pairs of important params
      operation_outcome_enum: SILA_OperationOutcome_Enum { Success, Failure_Permission, Failure_NotFound, Failure_IOError, Failure_PolicyViolation },
      error_details_ref_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_CapToken<SILA_Error_Record>>, // Capability to a more detailed error record if outcome was failure
      policy_evaluation_refs_array: SILA_Array<SILA_CapToken<SILA_PolicyEvaluationTrace_Record>>, // References to policy decisions that affected this op
      pqc_signature_of_record: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5> // Signed by the SKYAIFS ASA sub-component that logged the event (e.g., I/O Path ASA, specific Bot ASA)
    }`
*   **Secure Audit Log Stream & Management:**
    *   All SKYAIFS ASAs performing significant (policy-defined) operations must generate these `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record`s.
    *   These records are sent via a secure, PQC-encrypted SILA IPC channel to a dedicated "SKYAIFS_AuditLogManager_ASA".
    *   The AuditLogManager ASA is responsible for:
        1.  Batching records.
        2.  Periodically writing batches to an append-only log file within SKYAIFS. This log file itself is a sequence of PQC-signed data blocks.
        3.  Providing a PQC-secured SILA IPC interface for authorized security AI agents or system administrators to query and stream audit logs (e.g., based on time range, event type, initiating agent). Access is strictly controlled by SILA capabilities.
*   **Forensic Analysis by AI Agents:**
    *   The structured and typed nature of `SILA_SKYAIFS_AuditEvent_Record`s (being SILA Records themselves) facilitates automated processing, correlation, and reasoning by authorized security AI agents.
    *   These agents can use SILA's data manipulation and pattern matching capabilities (on SILA graphs/records) to perform threat hunting, compliance verification, and reconstruct event sequences.

## 8. Ecosystem Integration (SILA Context - New Section)
*   **AI Pipeline & SILA Module Storage:** Compiled SILA modules, including SKYAIFS's own ASA components and other OS services, are managed by the AI Pipeline. These modules are stored as regular files within SKYAIFS. SKYAIFS's transparent integration with the Deep Compression service means these SILA module files can be stored in a highly compressed state and decompressed on demand when the AI Pipeline's Module Manager SILA ASA requests them for loading via SKYAIFS's standard file access SILA APIs.
*   **Application Data for SILA Containers:** SILA applications running within Skyscope OS containers (as defined in `SILA_Containerization_Concept_V0.1.md`) will use SKYAIFS for their persistent data storage. SKYAIFS will enforce access controls based on the SILA capabilities granted to the container and the application ASA within it. Mount namespace emulation by SKYAIFS will provide each container with its isolated view of the filesystem.

## 9. Future Considerations for SKYAIFS
*   **Distributed SKYAIFS (Federated Learning Model):** Exploring concepts for extending SKYAIFS to operate across multiple networked Skyscope OS nodes. This might involve SILA-based distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Raft, Paxos implemented as SILA ASAs) for metadata consistency across nodes, and peer-to-peer SILA IPC for data transfer. AI bots could manage data placement and replication across the federation based on access patterns and policies.
*   **Fine-grained Data Deduplication with AI:** AI bots designed to analyze block content (respecting PQC encryption boundaries) to identify opportunities for fine-grained data deduplication. This would integrate with the Deep Compression service to optimize storage. SILA contracts would ensure data integrity.
*   **Verifiable Quotas and Resource Billing in SILA:** For multi-tenant or departmental use cases, implementing robust and formally verifiable resource quota tracking (storage space, I/O operations, number of files) for SKYAIFS. This could involve SILA ASAs that generate PQC-signed usage reports, potentially integrable with a SILA-based billing system.
*   **AI-driven Predictive Data Tiering & Lifecycle Management:** Advanced AI bots that predictively move data between different storage tiers (e.g., ultra-fast PQC-RAM disks, standard PQC-SSD, PQC-archival) based on access frequency, age, and SILA-defined data lifecycle policies. This includes secure PQC re-encryption if data moves between tiers with different key management policies.

## V0.2.0 Conclusion
SKYAIFS Conceptual Framework V0.2.0 details a highly advanced, AI-orchestrated filesystem engineered for the SILA-based Skyscope OS. It deeply embeds PQC security (min 4096-bit equivalent) and resilience through its AI bot ASA architecture and reliance on SILA's verifiable constructs. Key enhancements in this final iteration include the introduction of advanced AI bot concepts like Data Exfiltration Detection and Module-Aware Storage, a comprehensive SILA-based auditing and forensics framework, and clearer articulation of its integration within the broader Skyscope OS ecosystem (AI Pipeline, Containerization). This V0.2 framework provides a robust and innovative foundation for the subsequent detailed SILA design and implementation of SKYAIFS by AI agent teams.The file `SKYAIFS_Framework_V0.2.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements, marking the culmination of the 4-iteration refinement process for the SKYAIFS Conceptual Framework.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 4 and the overall Task Block 0.2. The next step is to report this completion.

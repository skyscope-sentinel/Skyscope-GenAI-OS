# SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents) Specification - V0.1 - Iteration 2

**Based on:** `SILA_Specification_V0.1.iter1.md`
**Iteration Focus:** Formal verifiability enhancements (contracts), concurrency model details, SILA runtime security, refined policy objects.

## 1. Name & Core Philosophy
Retained from Iteration 1.

## 3. Abstract Syntax & Structure
Retained from Iteration 1. Semantic Graphs with typed edges and attributed nodes remain central. Node attributes for PQC context and verification annotations are key.

## 4. Key Semantic Concepts

### 4.1. Data Types
Retained from Iteration 1, including parameterized `SILA_CapToken<Referenced_SILA_Type_Descriptor_Cap>` and ADK-driven PQC-Aware Structure definition (e.g., `ADK_Service_Cap.call_Define_PQC_Struct_Type`). The PQC policy associated with such types (`SILA_PQC_DataProtectionPolicy_Record`) is critical for defining cryptographic operations.

### 4.2. Control Flow (Conceptual)
*   **Event-Driven Constructs, State Machines:** Retained from previous iterations.
*   **Concurrent Constructs (Elaboration):**
    *   **Primary Model: Asynchronous Actor-Like SILA Agents (ASA):** SILA modules can be defined as ASAs.
        *   Each ASA possesses a private state (composed of SILA records and other data types, not directly accessible by other ASAs).
        *   Each ASA has a dedicated mailbox, which is a capability to a SILA Queue object (`SILA_Queue_CapToken<SILA_Message_Type_Cap>`).
        *   ASAs communicate by sending immutable SILA message structures (defined PQC-aware types) to another ASA's endpoint capability (which is typically linked to its mailbox).
        *   Execution is typically event-driven, triggered by message arrival.
    *   **Guarded Execution for Shared Resource Access (Conceptual):**
        *   For controlled access to shared, capability-protected resources (e.g., a system-wide configuration object, a hardware resource capability), SILA may support "Guarded Operations."
        *   These are SILA graph segments (operations or sub-graphs) whose execution is contingent upon a specified precondition (a SILA predicate graph) evaluating to true. The precondition check and operation execution must appear atomic from other ASAs' perspectives.
        *   This atomicity is managed by the SILA runtime, potentially involving short-lived resource locks or transactional semantics on the SILA graph operations. The SILA Verifier will analyze these for correctness.
    *   **Deadlock/Race Condition Prevention & Detection:**
        *   **Primary Prevention:** The ASA model (no shared mutable state between ASAs) and immutable messages are the primary mechanisms to minimize race conditions. Direct memory sharing is only possible via explicit, capability-controlled shared memory SILA objects, whose access must be strictly synchronized (e.g., using SILA-defined mutex capabilities or guarded operations).
        *   **SILA Verifier Analysis:** The SILA Verifier will incorporate algorithms to analyze SILA interaction protocols between ASAs for common deadlock patterns (e.g., cyclic dependencies in synchronous request-reply patterns built on top of asynchronous messaging). This might involve model checking techniques on the SILA interaction graphs.
        *   **Capability System:** The SILA capability system fundamentally prevents direct unauthorized access to another ASA's state or resources, reducing interference and race conditions.
        *   **Runtime Detection (Limited):** While prevention is preferred, the SILA runtime might include limited mechanisms for detecting livelocks or prolonged contention for resources, reporting these as system health SILA events.
*   **Policy-Driven Execution:**
    *   `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` (signed by a policy authority) retained from Iteration 1.
    *   **Refined `SILA_PolicyRule_Struct` (referenced by `SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap` in the policy record):**
        `// This is the conceptual content of the SILA graph referenced by SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap
        SILA_Graph_Define_PolicyRule {
          Input: current_operation_context_sila_record // Details about the operation being checked
          
          Nodes:
            1. ConditionNode: SILA_Evaluate_Predicate_Graph(current_operation_context, policy_specific_params_from_rule_record) -> is_applicable_bool
            2. If is_applicable_bool is TRUE:
                 Execute_ActionNode(current_operation_context, action_enum_from_rule_record, action_params_from_rule_record) -> policy_effect_sila_record
            3. Else:
                 Return NoEffect_SILA_Enum
        }
        // Where SILA_PolicyRule_Record (as defined in Iteration 1 by the ADK) would store:
        // rule_id: SILA_UniqueID,
        // trigger_condition_params: SILA_Any_Record, // Params for the Predicate_Graph
        // action_to_take: SILA_Action_Enum { Allow, Deny, Audit, RateLimit, ModifyOperation_RequestNewParams },
        // action_params: SILA_Optional<SILA_Any_Record>, // e.g., rate limit values, new params for ModifyOperation
        // target_resource_selector_params: SILA_Any_Record // Params for a graph that selects applicable resources
        }`
        The actual `SILA_PolicyRule_GraphHandle_Cap` points to a compiled, verifiable SILA graph segment that implements this logic.

### 4.3. Memory Management Model
Retained from Iteration 1. Capability-based access via Microkernel is fundamental. SILA's type system ensures that memory capabilities are used according to defined permissions (read, write, execute, PQC-protection attributes).

### 4.4. AI Integration Features
Retained from Iteration 1.

### 4.5. Formal Verifiability Enhancements
*   **Verifiable Contracts for SILA Modules/ASAs:**
    *   SILA modules (especially ASAs) can declare a `SILA_Module_Contract_Record` via the ADK. This record is PQC-signed and associated with the module's metadata.
    *   `SILA_Module_Contract_Record {
          contract_version: SILA_SemanticVersion_Struct,
          module_identity_cap: SILA_CapToken, // Capability to the module definition itself
          provides_interfaces_list: SILA_Array<SILA_InterfaceSpecification_CapToken>, // Capabilities to formal interface specs
          requires_capabilities_policy: SILA_Array<SILA_RequiredCapability_Policy_Record>, // Describes needed caps and their types/rights
          initialization_preconditions_graph_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_Predicate_Graph_Ref_Cap>, // Must hold before init
          initialization_postconditions_graph_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_Predicate_Graph_Ref_Cap>, // Will hold after successful init
          operation_contracts_map: SILA_Map<SILA_OperationName_String, SILA_OperationContract_Record_Cap>, // Contracts for key public operations
          temporal_properties_policy_list: SILA_Array<SILA_TemporalLogicPolicy_Record_Cap>, // e.g., LTL/CTL formulas as verifiable SILA predicate graphs over execution traces
          information_flow_policy_cap: SILA_Optional<SILA_InformationFlowPolicy_Definition_Cap>, // Cap to an information flow policy definition
          pqc_security_level_assertion: SILA_PQC_SecurityLevel_Enum // e.g., Level5_4096bit
        }`
    *   `SILA_OperationContract_Record {
          preconditions_graph_cap: SILA_Predicate_Graph_Ref_Cap,
          postconditions_graph_cap: SILA_Predicate_Graph_Ref_Cap,
          emitted_events_list: SILA_Array<SILA_EventType_Descriptor_Cap>
        }`
    *   The SILA Verifier checks module implementations (their SILA semantic graphs) against their declared contracts.
*   **Information Flow Control:**
    *   SILA will support defining information flow policies via `SILA_InformationFlowPolicy_Definition_Record`. These policies define sensitivity labels (SILA Enum types) and rules for how data with certain labels can flow between ASAs or be stored in PQC-aware structures.
    *   The SILA type system will be extended to associate these labels with data types and capabilities.
    *   The SILA Verifier will perform static analysis on SILA graphs to attempt to prove adherence to these policies (e.g., "data from a `HighSensitivity_Label` source must not flow to a `LowSensitivity_Label` sink unless via a `Trusted_Sanitizer_ASA_CapToken`").
*   **Temporal Logic Properties:**
    *   `SILA_TemporalLogicPolicy_Record` will encapsulate temporal properties (e.g., "event X will eventually be followed by event Y," "capability Z, once revoked, is never re-granted to the same ASA").
    *   The SILA Verifier will include model checking capabilities to verify these properties against the state machine representations derivable from SILA ASA graphs.

## 5. Non-Human Readability & AI Accessibility
Retained from Iteration 1. ADK remains key for AI agent interaction.

## 6. Toolchain Concept (AI-Driven)
Retained from Iteration 1. SILA Verifier capabilities are significantly expanded to support checking module contracts, information flow policies, and temporal logic properties. The Verifier must be able_to interpret and use the formal specifications and policies referenced in `SILA_Module_Contract_Record`.

## 7. SILA Runtime Security Considerations (Initial Thoughts)
*   **Minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB):** The SILA runtime environment itself (the core code that executes compiled SILA binaries, especially if any part of it is kernel-level or privileged) must be an absolute minimum and subject to the highest levels of formal verification.
*   **Secure Bootstrapping & Integrity:** The SILA runtime must be loaded securely by the underlying Microkernel (or be an integral part of it, if the Microkernel is itself a SILA program). Its own code and critical internal data structures must be PQC-signed and stored in read-only, integrity-protected memory.
*   **Capability System Enforcement:** The SILA runtime is the ultimate enforcer of the SILA capability system rules for operations that are not directly mapped to hardware-enforced capabilities by the Microkernel. This enforcement logic (e.g., checking rights on a `SILA_CapToken` before allowing an operation node in a SILA graph to execute) must be formally verified to be correct and complete.
*   **Isolation of SILA Processes/ASAs:** If multiple SILA ASAs or processes co-exist, the runtime (in conjunction with Microkernel primitives) must guarantee their strict isolation according to the capability model. This includes memory, IPC, and access to other resources. No ASA should be able to affect another except through legitimate, capability-mediated SILA IPC.
*   **Fault Isolation:** Faults or policy violations within one SILA ASA should not propagate to others unless via defined error reporting SILA events through authorized channels. The runtime must ensure fault containment.

## Iteration 2 Conclusion
This iteration has substantially detailed SILA's concurrency model around Asynchronous Actor-like SILA Agents (ASA). It has also significantly expanded the formal verifiability aspects by introducing comprehensive module contracts, including support for information flow control policies and temporal logic. Initial thoughts on the security requirements for the SILA runtime environment itself have been outlined, and policy rule objects were further refined. These enhancements aim to create a robust foundation for a verifiable and secure AI-centric OS.The file `SILA_Specification_V0.1.iter2.md` has been successfully created with the specified enhancements.

This completes the simulation of Iteration 2 for the SILA Specification. The next step is to report this completion.

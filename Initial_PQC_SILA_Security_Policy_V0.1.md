# Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document establishes the initial security policy for Skyscope OS, focusing on the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and the security implications of the **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)** programming language, SKYAIFS, and the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression mechanism. Its goal is to embed security deeply into the OS architecture from the outset.

## 2. PQC Algorithm Suite & Key Management

### 2.1. PQC Algorithm Standard
*   **Minimum Security Level:** All PQC algorithms used within Skyscope OS for key encapsulation, digital signatures, and any derived cryptographic functions must provide a **minimum of 4096-bit equivalent classical security**. This typically refers to NIST PQC Level V.
    *   **Key Encapsulation (KEM):** ML-KEM (CRYSTALS-Kyber) at a parameter set achieving at least Level V (e.g., Kyber-1024). Backup: HQC (similarly high level).
    *   **Digital Signatures:** ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) or FALCON at parameter sets achieving at least Level V (e.g., Dilithium-5, Falcon-1024). Backup: SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+).
    *   **Secure Hash Functions:** SHA3-256/SHA3-512 (FIPS 202) as baseline. Future PQC-specific hashes will be evaluated if they meet the security level and are standardized.
*   **Implementation Validation:** All PQC implementations must be validated against known test vectors and ideally sourced from audited libraries.

### 2.2. Key Management Principles
*   **Secure Generation:** PQC keys must be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators.
*   **Secure Storage:**
    *   Private keys must be stored with strong hardware-backed protection where possible (e.g., TPM, secure enclave).
    *   For AI agents/bots requiring keys, keys must be managed via secure vaulting mechanisms, accessible only via authenticated and authorized SILA capability-based calls.
    *   SILA's PQC-aware types should be used to handle keys in memory, minimizing exposure.
*   **Distribution:** Key distribution must use secure, authenticated channels, typically by exchanging PQC KEM ciphertexts.
*   **Rotation & Revocation:** Policies and mechanisms for PQC key rotation and revocation must be developed, considering the long-term nature of PQC. This is a critical area for further research in the SILA context.
*   **Least Privilege:** AI agents and SILA modules should only have access to the specific keys and cryptographic operations necessary for their function, enforced by the SILA capability system.

## 3. SILA Language Security

### 3.1. ADK Output Verification
*   **Automated Security Validation:** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) used by AI agents to generate SILA code must include automated security validation tools. These tools will check generated SILA semantic graphs against predefined security policies, looking for known anti-patterns, capability misuse, or insecure data flows.
*   **Formal Methods Integration:** SILA's verifiability should be leveraged to prove that ADK-generated code adheres to critical security properties.
*   **Trusted Generation Base:** The ADK components responsible for security-critical code generation must themselves be highly trusted and verified.

### 3.2. SILA Metadata Protection
*   **PQC Signing:** All SILA metadata associated with compiled binaries (describing structure, semantics, verification proofs) must be PQC-signed by a trusted entity (e.g., the SILA compiler or a secure build service).
*   **Access Control:** Access to sensitive SILA metadata must be strictly controlled, potentially using SILA capabilities. Only authorized AI tools, debuggers, or system agents should have read access. Modification must be prohibited post-compilation.
*   **Integrity Checks:** The OS must verify the integrity of SILA metadata before relying on it.

### 3.3. SILA Toolchain Security
*   **Compiler & Verifier Integrity:** The SILA compiler, SILA Verifier, and other critical ADK tools must be developed with high security standards, including formal verification of their core components if feasible.
*   **Supply Chain Security:** Secure development practices and supply chain security measures must be applied to the SILA toolchain itself.

## 4. Security Aspects of SKYAIFS

*   **Data Relocation Triggers:**
    *   Policies governing automated data relocation by SKYAIFS AI bots must be clearly defined and auditable.
    *   Relocation actions must require authorization from a high-privilege SKYAIFS supervisor agent or be triggered by authenticated alerts from OS security services.
*   **AI Bot Permissions:** SKYAIFS AI bots must operate under the principle of least privilege. Their access to data, metadata, and microkernel services will be strictly controlled by SILA capabilities.
*   **Metadata & Log Integrity:** All SKYAIFS metadata and activity logs (critical for forensics and monitoring) must be PQC-signed and protected against unauthorized modification or deletion.
*   **Confidentiality:** SKYAIFS must ensure confidentiality of file content and sensitive metadata using the mandated PQC KEMs with unique per-file/block keys.

## 5. Security of Deep Compression Mechanism

*   **Data Integrity & Authenticity:**
    *   Compressed data streams must include PQC-secure hashes or checksums to verify integrity upon decompression.
    *   If compressed data is stored or transmitted, it must be PQC-signed to ensure authenticity of origin.
*   **Secure AI Bot Operation:** AI bots involved in compression/decompression must operate with restricted privileges (SILA capabilities) and be isolated from other system components. Their code must be verified.
*   **DoS Prevention:** The Deep Compression service must include mechanisms to prevent denial-of-service attacks (e.g., malicious "zip bombs," resource exhaustion from excessive compression requests). Input validation and resource limiting are crucial.

## 6. Initial OS Threat Model (SILA & AI-Centric)

*   **Compromised ADK or AI Developer Agent:** Malicious or compromised AI agents with ADK access could generate insecure SILA code.
*   **SILA Metadata Tampering:** Attackers might attempt to tamper with SILA metadata to bypass security controls or cause misbehavior if not properly PQC-signed and verified.
*   **AI Bot Manipulation/Exploitation:** AI bots (in SKYAIFS, Deep Compression, AI Pipeline) could be targets for manipulation, leading to data leakage, corruption, or denial of service.
*   **PQC Implementation Flaws:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of PQC algorithms could undermine the entire security foundation.
*   **SILA Runtime Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in the SILA runtime (especially parts implemented within the microkernel) could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks against PQC/SILA:** The novel nature of SILA and PQC necessitates ongoing research into potential side-channel attack vectors.
*   **Policy Bypass:** Attempts to bypass security policies embedded in SILA code or enforced by the SILA verifier.

This policy document is a living document and will be updated as the Skyscope OS architecture evolves and new threats are identified. Regular security audits and formal verification efforts are paramount.The fourth document, `Initial_PQC_SILA_Security_Policy_V0.1.md`, has been created.

Finally, I will create the fifth document, which synthesizes the others:

# Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression Conceptual Framework - V0.2.0 (Final - Iteration 4)

**Based on:** `Deep_Compression_Framework_V0.1.iter3.md`
**Key Reference:** `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`
**This Version (V0.2.0) Goals:** Detail resource management for ASBs via SILA policies, explore interaction with SILA's verification ecosystem, reiterate ecosystem integration, and consolidate into a coherent V0.2 framework.

## 1. Core Principles
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA V0.2 (as defined in `SILA_Specification_V0.2.md`) is the foundational language for implementing the Deep Compression service, its AI Bot ASAs, its PQC-aware data structures (min 4096-bit security), and its interfaces. The goals of AI-Bot Driven operation, Extreme Compression Ratios (GBs to <150MB), Fast & Reliable Decompression, and Seamless OS Integration remain paramount.

## 2. AI Bot Roles (as SILA ASAs)

### 2.1. Analysis & Strategy Bot ASA (ASB_Analyzer)
Retained from Iteration 3. This ASA uses SILA-integrated AI models and queries the `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA` (which stores `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record`s) to dynamically select algorithms and construct a `SILA_CompressionPlan_Record`.

### 2.2. Parallel Processing Bot ASA Coordinator (ASB_Coordinator)
Retained from Iteration 3. Manages data chunking and distributes work to `ASB_Worker` ASAs using SILA concurrency patterns (e.g., work queues for a pool of workers).

### 2.3. Worker Compression/Decompression Bot ASA (ASB_Worker)
Retained from Iteration 3. These generic SILA ASA shells dynamically execute specific compression algorithms based on the `algorithm_worker_asa_module_cap` received in their work items.

### 2.4. Integrity Verification Bot ASA (ASB_Integrity)
Retained from Iteration 3. Crucial for verifying PQC hashes from the `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` against computed hashes of data before, during, and after compression/decompression.

### 2.5. Resource Management Bot ASA (ASB_ResourceManager) - SILA Policy Control
*   **Dynamic Policy Application:** The `ASB_ResourceManager` SILA ASA continuously monitors overall system load (via secure SILA introspection capabilities provided by the Microkernel, if permitted by its `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record`) and the specific resource requests embedded in incoming `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` capabilities.
*   **SILA Policies for ASB Pools & Operations:** It manages and applies a set of `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` capabilities that govern the behavior of the `ASB_Coordinator` and the pools of `ASB_Worker` ASAs. These policies can be dynamically updated by higher-level OS orchestrator ASAs or by the `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` (see Iteration 3) based on observed system performance and efficiency.
*   **Policy Content Examples:**
    *   `max_concurrent_asb_workers_global_int: SILA_Verifiable_Integer` (overall limit for the system).
    *   `default_cpu_quanta_per_worker_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_ResourceSchedulingPolicy_Record>` (default CPU share for a worker).
    *   `max_memory_allocation_per_job_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_MemoryQuotaPolicy_Record>` (max memory a single compression job can request).
    *   `job_priority_for_kernel_modules_enum: SILA_SchedulingPriority_Enum` (higher priority for critical OS components).
*   **Adaptation Logic (SILA Graph within ASB_ResourceManager):**
    1.  `ASB_ResourceManager` receives SILA events about current system performance (e.g., from Microkernel) and pending compression job queue length from `ASB_Coordinator`.
    2.  It queries the `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` to predict the resource impact of the current and queued jobs based on their `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` inputs.
    3.  Based on this prediction and overall system resource availability, it can make decisions:
        *   Adjust the `max_concurrent_asb_workers_global_int` for the `ASB_Coordinator`.
        *   Temporarily assign higher/lower `default_cpu_quanta_per_worker_cap` to the worker pool.
        *   Re-prioritize jobs in the `ASB_Coordinator`'s queue.
    4.  These adjustments are communicated by sending updated `SILA_ExecutionPolicy_Record` capabilities or specific SILA IPC command messages to the `ASB_Coordinator`.

## 3. Primary SILA IPC Service Interface
Retained from Iteration 3. The service exposes SILA operations like `SILA_DeepCompress_Request` (taking `data_to_compress_cap` and `compression_policy_hints_cap`) and `SILA_DeepDecompress_Request` (taking `data_to_decompress_cap` and `metadata_header_cap`). Responses are asynchronous SILA messages (`SILA_DeepCompress_Response_Record`, `SILA_DeepDecompress_Response_Record`).

## 4. Reliability and Error Handling in SILA
Retained from Iteration 3. SILA error records (e.g., `SILA_DecompressionIntegrityFailure_Event_Record`), ADK-generated retry patterns for worker failures, and verifiable SILA module contracts for each ASA type ensure robustness.

## 5. Performance Profiling & Dynamic Adaptation (SILA)
Retained from Iteration 3. `ASB_Worker` ASAs generate `SILA_CompressionOp_Performance_Record`s. The `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` aggregates this data, updates algorithm performance profiles in the `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA`, enabling `ASB_Analyzer` to make better strategy choices and `ASB_ResourceManager` to optimize resource allocation.

## 6. Data Structures & Algorithms / Self-Describing Format / Security
Retained from Iteration 3. The PQC-signed (e.g., MLDSA_5) `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` is fundamental. Enhanced security considerations include verification of this header's signature by `ASB_Integrity` before any decompression, per-chunk PQC hash verification, and optional AEAD layer for sensitive data using SILA PQC primitives (e.g., AES-GCM with MLKEM_1024 wrapped keys).

## 7. Formal Verification Targets for Deep Compression
Retained from Iteration 3:
1.  **ASB_Integrity Hash Verification Logic (SILA):** Verification of PQC hash checking.
2.  **ASB_Coordinator Data Capability Management (SILA):** Verification of secure handling of `SILA_MemoryRegion_Chunk_CapToken`s.
3.  **ASB_Analyzer Policy Enforcement for Algorithm Selection (SILA):** Verification that security-critical policies in `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` are correctly enforced.

## 8. Interaction with SILA's Formal Verification Ecosystem (New Section)

*   **Leveraging Algorithm Verification Status in ASB_Analyzer:**
    *   The `verification_and_audit_status_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_FormalVerification_Summary_Record>` within the `SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record` (obtained from the `SILA_CompressorRegistry_ASA`) is a critical input for the `ASB_Analyzer`.
    *   The incoming `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` (on a compression request) can specify:
        *   `require_formally_verified_algorithms_bool: SILA_Secure_Boolean`.
        *   `min_assurance_level_for_algorithm_enum: SILA_VerificationAssuranceLevel_Enum`.
    *   `ASB_Analyzer`'s SILA logic will filter algorithm choices from the registry based on these policy requirements and the verification status of each algorithm. For instance, compressing a critical SILA kernel module might mandate using only algorithms with `FullyVerified_EnumVal` status.
*   **"Compression Attestation" (Conceptual SILA Structure for High Assurance):**
    *   Upon successful and verified compression, particularly for critical data or when policy requires it, the `ASB_Coordinator` can interact with a dedicated "SILA_DeepCompression_AttestationService_ASA" to generate a PQC-signed `SILA_CompressionAttestation_Record`.
    *   `SILA_CompressionAttestation_Record {
          attestation_id: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          compression_job_id_ref: SILA_UniqueID_String,
          input_data_pqc_hash_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Hash_Record>,
          output_compressed_data_pqc_hash_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Hash_Record>,
          used_metadata_header_pqc_hash_cap: SILA_CapToken<SILA_PQC_Hash_Record>, // Hash of the metadata header used
          used_algorithm_descriptor_cap_ref: SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionAlgorithm_Descriptor_Record>, // Includes its own verification status
          applied_compression_policy_cap_ref: SILA_CapToken<SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record>,
          timestamp_of_attestation: SILA_Timestamp_Record,
          attestation_service_pqc_signature: SILA_PQC_Signature_Record<MLDSA_5> // Signed by the Attestation Service
        }`
    *   This attestation provides a verifiable audit trail that a specific compression task was performed using a known (and potentially formally verified) algorithm, adhering to a given policy, and that input/output data integrity was maintained. The AI Pipeline might store this attestation alongside the compressed SILA module in the repository. It can be used for compliance and high-assurance scenarios.

## 9. Ecosystem Integration Points (SILA Context - Reiteration)
*   **AI Pipeline (Module Management):** The primary client. It invokes the Deep Compression SILA service (via its well-known SILA endpoint capability) to compress compiled SILA modules before storing them in the PQC-secured module repository. It also invokes the service to decompress these modules during the OS deployment or on-demand loading process. The AI Pipeline passes relevant `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` capabilities to guide the compression.
*   **SKYAIFS (Transparent File Compression):** SKYAIFS AI Bot ASAs can optionally invoke the Deep Compression SILA service to compress user file blocks before writing them to storage managed by the Microkernel, and to decompress them upon read. This is governed by SKYAIFS internal policies and the `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` associated with files or directories.
*   **OS Loader/Microkernel (Early Boot):** For critical OS components (including parts of the Microkernel itself or early-boot SILA ASAs) that might be stored in a deeply compressed form in boot memory, a minimal, highly trusted SILA-based decompressor stub (potentially part of the Microkernel's earliest SILA code) would interact with a simplified version of the Deep Compression logic or directly interpret the `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record`.

## 10. Future Considerations for Deep Compression
*   **Hardware-Accelerated Compression ASAs & SILA Primitives:** Design SILA interfaces and Microkernel abstractions to allow `ASB_Worker` ASAs to offload computationally intensive compression/decompression tasks to specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., future PQC-optimized compression ASICs, NPUs). This involves defining SILA capabilities for accessing such accelerators.
*   **Verifiable Lossy Deep Compression for Specific Data Types:** Research and develop SILA-based frameworks for policy-controlled, verifiable lossy deep compression. This would be for data types where some information loss is acceptable (e.g., large telemetry data, certain AI model weights for non-critical inference, streaming media). SILA contracts would define acceptable loss metrics and verification methods.
*   **Interoperability & Standardization of PQC-Signed Compressed Format:** While primarily for internal Skyscope OS use, explore if a subset of the PQC-signed `SILA_CompressionMetadataHeader_Record` and stream format could be proposed for standardization to allow (authorized) data interchange or recovery with external trusted tools, without compromising Skyscope's security principles.
*   **Energy-Aware Compression Policies in SILA:** Enhance `SILA_CompressionStrategyPolicy_Record` to include `energy_consumption_target_enum: SILA_EnergyProfile_Enum {MinimizeEnergy, Balanced, MaxPerformance}`. The `ASB_Analyzer` and `ASB_ResourceManager` would then use this to select algorithms and manage parallelism in a way that respects power budgets, especially for mobile or edge deployments of Skyscope OS. This requires the `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA` to also track energy metrics.
*   **AI-Driven Discovery of Novel Compression Algorithms:** Conceptualize a feedback loop where the `SILA_Compression_PerformanceModel_ASA`, upon identifying data patterns that are poorly compressed by existing registered algorithms, could trigger specialized AI research agents (part of the broader Skyscope AI ecosystem) to attempt to synthesize or discover new SILA-based compression techniques or preprocessing graph segments.

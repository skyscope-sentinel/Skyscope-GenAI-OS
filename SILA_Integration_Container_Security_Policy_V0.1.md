# SILA Integration & Container Security Policy V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document updates and expands upon the `Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1` from Stage 2. It specifically addresses the security implications of integrating core SILA-based components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline) and the introduction of the SILA OS-level containerization model as defined in Stage 3 design specifications. The foundational requirement of **minimum 4096-bit equivalent PQC security (NIST PQC Level V)** for all cryptographic operations remains paramount.

## 2. Security Policies for Integrated SILA Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

### 2.1. Microkernel-SKYAIFS IPC
*   **Policy MKI-IPC-001 (Encrypted Channels):** All SILA IPC channels between the Microkernel and SKYAIFS that might transit sensitive data (e.g., derived PQC keys, detailed fault information not intended for wider system logs) must utilize SILA's PQC-encrypted communication primitives or be demonstrably protected by kernel-level isolation for point-to-point SILA calls.
*   **Policy MKI-IPC-002 (Capability Validation):** The Microkernel must rigorously validate the SILA capabilities presented by SKYAIFS for every operation, ensuring SKYAIFS only accesses authorized storage devices, memory regions, or privileged SILA operations. SKYAIFS must do likewise for callbacks or event EPs provided by the kernel.
*   **Policy MKI-IPC-003 (DoS Prevention):** SILA IPC mechanisms between Microkernel and SKYAIFS must include rate limiting or queuing policies to prevent DoS scenarios (e.g., SKYAIFS flooding the kernel with I/O requests, or kernel overwhelming SKYAIFS with fault events). Resource quotas associated with SILA endpoints shall be used.

### 2.2. Pipeline-Microkernel IPC
*   **Policy PM-IPC-001 (Module Loading Security):** The SILA IPC protocol for module loading must ensure that the Microkernel only accepts `SILA_LoadModule_Request` calls from an authenticated AI Pipeline Service capability. The Microkernel must re-verify PQC signatures on the SILA binary and manifest if not loaded from a kernel-trusted cache.
*   **Policy PM-IPC-002 (Resource Allocation Integrity):** SILA IPC calls from the AI Pipeline to the Microkernel for dynamic resource allocation (for ADK tools, modules) must be subject to system-wide resource availability checks and policies to prevent resource exhaustion by the pipeline itself.

## 3. SILA Containerization Security Policies

### 3.1. Isolation Guarantees
*   **Policy CON-ISO-001 (Default Deny Access):** SILA containers must operate under a default-deny security posture. No SILA process within a container can access memory, SILA capabilities, or SILA IPC endpoints belonging to another container or the host Microkernel/OS services, unless explicitly granted by a valid, authorized SILA capability.
*   **Policy CON-ISO-002 (Microkernel Enforcement):** The SILA Microkernel is responsible for enforcing memory isolation (via its SILA address space management) and capability segregation between SILA containers. These enforcement mechanisms must be primary targets for formal verification.

### 3.2. Namespace Security
*   **Policy CON-NS-001 (Namespace Integrity):** The SILA mechanisms used for emulating namespaces (PID, Mount, Network, IPC, User) must be designed to prevent information leakage between containers or unauthorized influence on other containers' namespaces.
*   **Policy CON-NS-002 (Namespace Server Security):** If dedicated "Namespace SILA Server Agents" are used, they must be highly trusted, formally verified components. Their SILA IPC interfaces must be protected, and they must operate with minimal necessary privileges.

### 3.3. Resource Management Security
*   **Policy CON-RES-001 (Strict Quota Enforcement):** The SILA Microkernel must strictly enforce resource quotas (CPU, memory, I/O, SILA object counts) defined in a container's `SILA_ResourceQuota_CapToken`s. Exceeding quotas must result in defined, auditable actions (e.g., denial of service, container termination, event notification to supervisor).
*   **Policy CON-RES-002 (Prevent Unfair Dominance):** Container resource allocation policies must prevent a single container or a small group from unfairly dominating system resources to the detriment of other containers or critical OS services.

### 3.4. SILA Container Image Security
*   **Policy CON-IMG-001 (PQC Signing & Verification):** All SILA container images and their constituent SILA module manifests must be PQC-signed by a trusted entity within the AI Pipeline. The OS (Microkernel loader or secure Module Manager agent) must verify these signatures before any part of the container image is processed or executed.
*   **Policy CON-IMG-002 (Secure Storage & Distribution):** SILA container images stored in the AI Pipeline's module repository must be protected against unauthorized modification using SKYAIFS PQC security features. Distribution channels must ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   **Policy CON-IMG-003 (Manifest Integrity):** The SILA manifest within a container image, detailing required capabilities and configurations, must be immutable post-signing. The Microkernel must only grant capabilities explicitly listed in this verified manifest.

### 3.5. Secure Inter-Container Communication
*   **Policy CON-ICC-001 (Explicit Authorization):** All SILA IPC channels between different containers must be explicitly authorized by a "Container Supervisor SILA Agent" based on system-wide security policies. Default is no communication.
*   **Policy CON-ICC-002 (Microkernel Mediation & Capability Control):** Inter-container SILA IPC must be mediated by the Microkernel, which enforces that communication only occurs via the specifically granted shared SILA endpoint capabilities.
*   **Policy CON-ICC-003 (PQC for Sensitive Data):** If sensitive data is exchanged between containers, the SILA IPC channel policy should mandate or enable PQC-encryption at the message level, even if the channel endpoints are kernel-managed.

## 4. Formal Verification Requirements for Integration & Containers (Examples)

*   **Microkernel-SKYAIFS I/O Path:**
    *   *"Prove that the SILA IPC protocol for raw block I/O between SKYAIFS and the Microkernel maintains data integrity (no unauthorized modification during transit) and prevents any leakage or unauthorized elevation of SILA capabilities related to storage devices or memory buffers."*
*   **Container Memory Isolation (Microkernel):**
    *   *"Prove, based on the SILA Microkernel's memory management logic, that a SILA process executing within Container A cannot read, write, or execute memory allocated to Container B, nor to the host Microkernel, unless explicitly permitted by an authorized shared memory SILA capability."*
*   **Container Namespace Emulation (e.g., PID Namespace Logic):**
    *   *"Prove that the SILA logic responsible for PID namespace emulation ensures that a SILA process within a container cannot observe or signal SILA processes outside its own PID namespace."*
*   **Inter-Container IPC Authorization (Container Supervisor Agent):**
    *   *"Prove that the SILA logic of the Container Supervisor Agent correctly enforces the system-wide policy for authorizing IPC channels between containers, only granting endpoint capabilities as per policy."*

## 5. PQC Application in Integrated Systems & Containers

*   **Reaffirmation:** Adherence to **minimum 4096-bit equivalent PQC security (NIST PQC Level V)** is mandatory for:
    *   Signing/verifying SILA container images and their manifests.
    *   Securing inter-component SILA IPC channels if they traverse untrusted domains or if policy dictates end-to-end encryption.
    *   Protecting any persistent state related to container configuration, management, or security policies (e.g., stored in SKYAIFS).
    *   All cryptographic operations supporting SILA's PQC-aware data types.

## 6. Threat Model Update for Integrated & Containerized OS

Building on Stage 2 threat model, new considerations include:

*   **Inter-Component Protocol Exploitation:** Vulnerabilities in the design or implementation of SILA IPC protocols between core components (Microkernel, SKYAIFS, AI Pipeline) could be exploited.
*   **Container Escape Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in Microkernel SILA logic for namespace separation, resource control, or capability enforcement could lead to a SILA process escaping its container's isolation boundaries.
*   **Attacks on Container Image Lifecycle:** Tampering with SILA container images in the repository or during distribution; exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Deep Compression service during image decompression.
*   **Inter-Container Attacks:** Malicious SILA containers attempting to interfere with or access data from other containers through authorized (but perhaps misconfigured) or unauthorized (exploiting a vulnerability) inter-container SILA IPC channels.
*   **Denial of Service via Resource Quota Mismanagement:** Exploiting flaws in how the Microkernel enforces resource quotas for SILA containers.
*   **Compromised Container Supervisor Agent:** If the "Container Supervisor SILA Agent" is compromised, it could establish unauthorized inter-container communication channels.

**Mitigation Strategies:** Rigorous formal verification of critical SILA modules (as listed), defense-in-depth using SILA capabilities, continuous security monitoring by dedicated AI security agents, fault isolation provided by the Microkernel, and robust PQC application.The fourth document, `SILA_Integration_Container_Security_Policy_V0.1.md`, has been created.

Finally, I will create the fifth document for Stage 3, which synthesizes the others:

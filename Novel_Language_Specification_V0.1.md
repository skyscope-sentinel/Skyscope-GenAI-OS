# Novel Programming Language Specification V0.1

## 1. Name
**Proposed Name:** SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)

## 2. Core Philosophy
SILA is an AI-first, non-human-readable programming language designed for developing the Skyscope OS and its components. Its core philosophy emphasizes:
*   **AI-Centric Design:** SILA is structured for optimal generation, comprehension, and manipulation by AI agents, not humans.
*   **Verifiability:** The language constructs will be designed to facilitate formal verification and proof of correctness, aligning with the microkernel's goals.
*   **Security:** Security principles, including PQC-awareness and capability-based concepts, are to be embedded at a fundamental level.
*   **Efficiency:** Optimized for generating highly efficient code for OS development, particularly for concurrent and real-time systems.
*   **Abstraction:** Provides high levels of abstraction suitable for AI agents to reason about complex OS behaviors.

## 3. Abstract Syntax & Structure
Direct human-readable syntax (like text-based code) is eschewed. AI agents will interact with SILA programs as:
*   **Semantic Graphs:** Programs are represented as rich semantic graphs where nodes are operations or data structures, and edges define relationships, control flow, or data flow.
*   **Abstract Object Manipulation:** AI agents manipulate these graph structures via a specialized API/SDK, rather than text editing.
*   **Layered Representation:** Multiple layers of abstraction may exist, from high-level intent graphs to lower-level verifiable operation chains.

## 4. Key Semantic Concepts

### 4.1. Data Types
*   **Primitive Types:**
    *   Verifiable Integers (various bit-widths, with range proofs).
    *   Secure Booleans (cryptographically bound).
    *   Capability Tokens (unforgeable references to kernel objects or resources).
*   **Complex Types:**
    *   **PQC-Aware Structures:** Data structures will have explicit PQC protection attributes (e.g., `Encrypted<ML-KEM_4096, DataType>`, `Signed<ML-DSA_8, DataType>`).
    *   **Agent-Oriented Records:** Structures optimized for AI reasoning, possibly with embedded metadata or behavioral contracts.
    *   **Immutable Data Structures:** Emphasis on immutability to aid verification and concurrency.
*   **No Nulls:** The language will be designed to avoid null references, using option types or similar constructs.

### 4.2. Control Flow (Conceptual)
*   **Event-Driven Constructs:** Native support for event handling and asynchronous operations.
*   **State Machines:** Formal state machine definitions as a primary way to model component behavior.
*   **Concurrent Constructs:** High-level primitives for concurrency and synchronization suitable for AI agent orchestration (e.g., actor models, guarded commands).
*   **Policy-Driven Execution:** Control flow may be influenced by verifiable security or operational policies attached to code modules.

### 4.3. Memory Management Model
*   **Capability-Based Access:** All memory access is mediated by capabilities.
*   **Region-Based Management:** Memory organized into protected regions, with AI agents managing allocation and deallocation within these regions under kernel supervision.
*   **Integration with Microkernel:** SILA's memory model will directly interface with the Skyscope microkernel's capability system and untyped memory model. No raw pointers in the traditional sense.

### 4.4. AI Integration Features
*   **Native AI Model Invocation:** Primitives to securely call and manage AI models (local LLMs, decision models) as part of program execution.
*   **Secure Data Pipelines:** Constructs for defining secure data flows to and from AI models.
*   **Intent Translation:** High-level constructs that allow AI agents to translate user or system intents into verifiable SILA code sequences.

## 5. Non-Human Readability & AI Accessibility
*   **Obfuscated Binary Format:** SILA source (semantic graphs) compiles to a secure, opaque binary format. This format is not designed for human reverse engineering.
*   **Rich Metadata Layer:** The compiled binaries will contain a rich, PQC-signed metadata layer accessible only to authorized AI tools and agents. This metadata describes structure, semantics, and verification proofs.
*   **Agent Development Kit (ADK):** AI developers (the simulated team) will use a specialized ADK. This ADK provides:
    *   APIs for constructing and manipulating SILA semantic graphs.
    *   Simulation and verification tools.
    *   Visualizers for AI agents to "understand" code structure (not human-readable syntax).
*   **No Direct Human Modification:** Humans define requirements and policies; AI agents generate and maintain SILA code via the ADK.

## 6. Toolchain Concept (AI-Driven)
*   **SILA Compiler:** Translates semantic graphs into the secure binary format. Includes formal verification passes.
*   **SILA Verifier:** Standalone tool for verifying SILA modules against specifications and policies.
*   **SILA Debugger (Agent-Oriented):** Allows AI agents to trace execution, inspect state (via controlled interfaces), and diagnose issues at the semantic graph level.
*   **SILA Analyzer:** Static and dynamic analysis tools for performance, security, and correctness, designed for AI agent consumption.

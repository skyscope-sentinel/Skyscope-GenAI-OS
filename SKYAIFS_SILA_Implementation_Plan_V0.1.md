# SKYAIFS SILA Implementation Plan V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the implementation plan for the SKYAIFS (Skyscope AI Filesystem), leveraging the **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)**. It builds upon the SKYAIFS Conceptual Framework V0.1, detailing how its AI-driven, PQC-secured features will be realized using SILA's unique capabilities.

## 2. SILA Data Structures for SKYAIFS

### 2.1. Metadata Representation
*   **Core Metadata Structures:** Key filesystem metadata elements such as inodes (or SKYAIFS logical file descriptors), directory entries, and dynamic block allocation maps will be defined as SILA semantic graph structures.
    *   Example: An inode-equivalent might be a SILA record `SKYAIFS_File_Descriptor` containing fields like `owner_id`, `permissions`, `pqc_content_key_ref`, `dynamic_block_map_capability`.
*   **PQC Protection:** All such SILA structures holding sensitive metadata will inherently use SILA's PQC-aware types.
    *   Example: `SILA_PQC_Protected<ML-KEM_4096, SKYAIFS_File_Descriptor>` or `SILA_PQC_Signed<ML-DSA_8, SKYAIFS_Directory_Block>`. The choice of 4096-bit equivalent security (e.g. Kyber-1024 for ML-KEM, Dilithium-5 for ML-DSA, Falcon-1024) is enforced at the type system level in SILA. Unique encryption keys per instance will be derived and managed via SILA's capability system.
*   **Merkle Trees:** Merkle tree nodes will also be SILA structures, with hash values computed using PQC-secure hash functions specified in SILA (e.g., SHA3-256/512 as a baseline until dedicated PQC hashes are standardized and integrated into SILA). The root hash will be PQC-signed.

### 2.2. Versioning and Immutability
*   **SILA Immutable Constructs:** SKYAIFS will leverage SILA's native support for immutable data structures. When metadata is updated, a new version of the SILA structure (or graph segment) is created, and the old one is archived or superseded, rather than modified in place.
*   **Versioning Scheme:** A SILA-defined versioning attribute will be part of key metadata structures, managed by SKYAIFS logic.

### 2.3. Dynamic Block Management
*   **Logical Block Representation:** Variable-sized logical blocks will be described by SILA structures containing metadata like `block_id`, `actual_size_bytes`, `checksum_pqc_hash`, and a capability reference to the actual data (which might be on raw storage or a compressed object).
*   **Allocation Maps:** Instead of traditional bitmaps, SKYAIFS might use more complex SILA graph structures (e.g., trees or linked lists of allocation records) to manage these dynamic blocks, optimized for AI agent traversal and manipulation. These structures will also be PQC-protected.

## 3. AI Bot Orchestration in SILA

*   **Bot Definitions:** The various SKYAIFS AI bots (defragmentation, data relocation, predictive placement, integrity verification) will be implemented as distinct SILA modules or complex SILA agent constructs.
*   **State Machines & Concurrency:**
    *   SILA's formal state machine definitions will be used to model the lifecycle and operational states of each bot.
    *   SILA's high-level concurrent constructs (e.g., actor models, guarded commands within SILA semantic graphs) will manage parallel bot operations and their interactions with shared SKYAIFS data structures (via capability-mediated access).
*   **Policy-Driven Execution:**
    *   SILA policies, attached to bot modules or SKYAIFS supervisor agents, will govern bot actions. For example, a policy might define thresholds for triggering data relocation or specify resource limits for defragmentation bots. These policies are themselves verifiable SILA constructs.
*   **Event Handling:** Bots will react to filesystem events (e.g., high I/O on a file, new data written, corruption detected) using SILA's native event-driven programming model.

## 4. SILA-Defined Interfaces

### 4.1. Interaction with Microkernel
*   **Storage Access:** SKYAIFS will request capabilities to raw storage devices from the SILA-based microkernel via specific SILA IPC calls (e.g., `Microkernel_Request_RawStorage_Capability`).
*   **Memory Management:** SKYAIFS will use standard SILA mechanisms to request and manage memory for its internal operations, caches, and I/O buffers, all mediated by the microkernel's SILA memory management services.
*   **IPC:** All communication with the microkernel (e.g., for fault reporting) will use SILA's secure IPC mechanisms.

### 4.2. Interaction with Deep Compression Service
*   **SILA Calls:** SKYAIFS will interact with the Skyscope Sentinel Deep Compression service via a well-defined SILA API.
    *   `DeepCompression_Compress_Block(input_block_cap, &compressed_block_cap, compression_policy_sila_structure)`
    *   `DeepCompression_Decompress_Block(compressed_block_cap, &output_block_cap)`
*   **Transparent Compression:** For files marked for transparent compression, SKYAIFS AI bots will invoke these SILA calls when reading/writing data blocks.

### 4.3. External API for OS Services/Applications
*   **High-Level SILA Operations:** SKYAIFS will expose a set of high-level SILA operations for common file operations (e.g., `SKYAIFS_OpenFile(path_sila_string, flags_sila_enum, &file_descriptor_cap)`).
*   **Capability-Based Access:** All returned file descriptors or handles will be SILA capability tokens, ensuring that subsequent operations are authorized.

## 5. PQC Application within SILA Structures
*   **Universal Application:** As mandated by the Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy, all SKYAIFS data structures in SILA, whether representing file content keys, metadata, or internal bot state, will use PQC algorithms ensuring at least 4096-bit equivalent security levels (e.g. ML-KEM with Kyber-1024, ML-DSA with Dilithium-5).
*   **Type Enforcement:** SILA's type system will enforce these PQC requirements. For example, a SILA structure for an inode might be defined as `SILA_PQC_Encrypted<ML-KEM_1024, SKYAIFS_Inode_Data_Record>`, making cryptographic protection non-optional and verifiable.
*   **Integrity and Confidentiality:** This ensures both the integrity (via PQC signatures like ML-DSA) and confidentiality (via PQC KEMs like ML-KEM) of all filesystem data and metadata managed through SILA.The second document, `SKYAIFS_SILA_Implementation_Plan_V0.1.md`, has been created.

Next, I will create the third document:

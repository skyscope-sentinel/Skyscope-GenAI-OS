# Refined SILA Security Policies & Verification Requirements V0.1

## 1. Introduction
This document updates and refines the `Initial PQC & SILA Security Policy V0.1` based on the detailed SILA-based designs emerging from Stage 2 for the Microkernel, SKYAIFS, and AI Pipeline/ADK. It provides more component-specific security policies and establishes clearer targets for formal verification efforts within the **SILA (Sentient Intermediate Language for Agents)** framework. The overarching PQC standard of **minimum 4096-bit equivalent security (NIST PQC Level V)** for all cryptographic operations (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, FALCON, etc.) remains in full effect.

## 2. Component-Specific SILA Security Policies

### 2.1. Microkernel
*   **Capability Integrity:** SILA operations manipulating capability tokens (e.g., `SILA_Cap_Mint`, `SILA_Cap_Copy`, `SILA_Cap_Delete`) must ensure that no operation can result in an invalid capability state, unauthorized escalation of rights, or bypass of guard conditions. All such operations must be formally verifiable.
*   **IPC Message Security:** SILA IPC mechanisms must enforce that messages (SILA structures) are only delivered to endpoints for which the sender possesses a valid send capability. If messages are PQC-encrypted via SILA's type system, the kernel must ensure key isolation between TCBs. Message content passing through the kernel must not be alterable by the kernel unless explicitly permitted by policy (e.g., for debug).
*   **TCB State Transitions:** SILA state machines governing TCB lifecycle (create, ready, running, blocked, suspend, destroy) must be formally verified to prevent unauthorized state changes or interference between TCBs. PQC encryption of TCB register state when off-CPU must be enforced.
*   **Secure Bootstrapping of SILA:** The initial SILA graph executed at boot must be minimal, PQC-signed, and its primary function must be to establish a secure root of trust for the rest of the SILA kernel and subsequent SILA modules. Its interactions with the bootloader must be strictly defined and minimized.
*   **Fault Handling Integrity:** The SILA fault dispatching mechanism must ensure that faults are reliably delivered to the correct, pre-registered fault handler endpoint (capability) and that fault message SILA structures cannot be tampered with by user-level TCBs.

### 2.2. SKYAIFS
*   **AI Bot Authorization & Behavior:**
    *   SKYAIFS AI bots must operate under strict SILA capability-based constraints (Principle of Least Privilege). Capabilities granted to bots must be specific to their function and limited in scope and duration.
    *   Data relocation by AI bots (e.g., in response to threat alerts) must be triggered by authenticated SILA events from authorized sources (e.g., OS Security Service, multi-factor AI agent consensus). A SILA policy must define the authorization criteria.
    *   AI bots accessing PQC encryption keys (e.g., for re-encrypting data during relocation) must do so via a secure SILA interface to a key vault, using ephemeral session capabilities if possible.
*   **Metadata Operation Integrity:** All SILA graph operations modifying SKYAIFS metadata must be atomic (or achieve effective atomicity via journaling/versioning in SILA) and result in PQC-signed, consistent metadata states. Concurrent access to metadata by multiple AI bots must be managed by SILA's concurrency control mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
*   **Deep Compression Interaction:** SILA calls from SKYAIFS to the Deep Compression service must ensure that the correct compression/decompression policies are applied and that data integrity is maintained (via PQC hashes) across these operations. Capabilities to data blocks must be correctly managed.

### 2.3. AI Pipeline & ADK
*   **Secure SILA Code Generation (ADK):** The SILA ADK, when used by AI agents to generate SILA semantic graphs, must incorporate automated checks to ensure generated code adheres to system-wide security policies (e.g., no hardcoded capabilities, proper error handling, adherence to PQC type usage).
*   **SILA Toolchain Integrity:** The SILA Compiler, SILA Verifier, and core ADK libraries must be PQC-signed, and their integrity must be verified by the AI Pipeline before use. The AI Pipeline must use secure SILA mechanisms to invoke these tools.
*   **PQC Key Handling for Module Signing:** Private PQC keys used by the AI Pipeline for signing compiled SILA binaries and manifests must be stored in a highly secure hardware vault, accessible only via a strictly controlled SILA interface to a signing service agent.
*   **Repository Security:** The SILA module repository must enforce PQC signature verification on all submitted SILA packages and manifests. Access control for publishing and retrieving modules must be robust.

## 3. Formal Verification Requirements for Critical SILA Modules

Formal verification using the SILA Verifier tool is mandated for the following (examples, non-exhaustive):

*   **Microkernel - IPC Subsystem:**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that SILA IPC `Send`, `Receive`, `Call`, `Reply` operations maintain data confidentiality (no leakage to unauthorized EPs) and integrity (no tampering) between authorized endpoints, as defined by the rights of the SILA capabilities involved.
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that no sequence of IPC operations can lead to kernel deadlock or livelock.
*   **Microkernel - Capability Management:**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that SILA `Cap_Mint` operation strictly ensures that derived capabilities do not possess rights exceeding the original capability, and that guard conditions are correctly applied.
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that `Cap_Revoke` correctly invalidates all derived capabilities and that no dangling references remain.
*   **Microkernel - TCB Scheduler (Core Logic):**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that the SILA scheduling logic correctly enforces priority levels and prevents starvation of high-priority threads under defined conditions.
*   **SKYAIFS - Metadata Update Atomicity:**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that core SILA graph operations for updating SKYAIFS metadata (e.g., file creation, block allocation changes) are atomic or preserve consistency in the event of simulated faults.
*   **SKYAIFS - AI Bot Authorization Logic:**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that the SILA logic governing SKYAIFS AI bot authorization for critical actions (e.g., data relocation, key access) correctly enforces defined security policies and cannot be bypassed.
*   **SILA ADK - Core Graph Validation API:**
    *   **Requirement:** Prove that the SILA ADK's core APIs for validating SILA semantic graphs correctly identify known insecure patterns or policy violations.

## 4. Threat Model Refinement & Mitigation Strategies

Refining Stage 1 Threat Model based on detailed SILA designs:

*   **Threat: Compromised ADK or AI Developer Agent generating malicious SILA code.**
    *   **Mitigation:** M-of-N AI agent consensus for committing critical SILA code; rigorous automated security validation within ADK; formal verification of critical generated SILA modules; runtime monitoring of SILA module behavior by security AI agents.
*   **Threat: SILA Metadata Tampering to alter execution logic or bypass security.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Mandatory PQC signing of all SILA metadata by trusted toolchain components; verification of these signatures by the OS loader and SILA runtime before use.
*   **Threat: Exploitation of AI Bot Logic (SKYAIFS, Deep Compression, Pipeline).**
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict SILA capability-based sandboxing of all AI bots; formal verification of critical bot decision logic; continuous monitoring and anomaly detection of bot behavior; robust input validation for all SILA interfaces used by bots.
*   **Threat: Vulnerabilities in PQC Algorithm Implementations within SILA primitives.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Use of officially validated PQC libraries (FIPS certified where applicable); multiple independent reviews of SILA's PQC primitive wrappers; ongoing monitoring of PQC research for new attack vectors. Consider hybrid schemes if specific PQC algos show weakness.
*   **Threat: Vulnerabilities in the SILA Runtime Environment (especially kernel-level SILA interpreter/executor).**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementation of the core SILA runtime in a restricted, verifiable subset of SILA itself if possible; extensive testing and formal verification of the SILA runtime; hardware assists for SILA execution if feasible.

## 5. PQC Key Lifecycle Management in SILA Systems

*   **SILA Structures for Key Management:**
    *   Define SILA record structures for key requests, key properties (e.g., `SILA_PQC_Key_Descriptor { key_id, algorithm_enum, security_level_enum, owner_agent_cap }`).
    *   SILA capabilities will represent possession of or access rights to keys or key vault operations.
*   **Secure Provisioning to AI Bots/Services:**
    *   Keys needed by SILA-based AI bots or system services must be provisioned through a secure SILA IPC channel from a dedicated Key Management Service (itself a SILA module). This service interfaces with hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure vaults.
    *   Use of ephemeral session keys (derived via PQC KEMs) for ongoing SILA bot-to-bot or bot-to-service communication.
*   **Integrity of Key-Referencing Structures:** Any SILA structure that contains a capability to a PQC key, or contains encrypted key material, must itself be PQC-signed or stored in integrity-protected memory to prevent tampering.
*   **Rotation/Revocation:** Define SILA protocols for initiating key rotation. Revocation might involve updating SILA capability spaces to invalidate capabilities to old keys and distributing PQC-signed revocation lists or using on-line validation via the Key Management Service. This remains an area of active design.
*   **Reaffirmation of Security Level:** All PQC keys and operations must maintain the minimum 4096-bit equivalent security level (NIST PQC Level V).The fourth document, `Refined_SILA_Security_Policies_Verification_Reqts_V0.1.md`, has been created.

Finally, I will create the fifth document, which synthesizes the others for Stage 2:
